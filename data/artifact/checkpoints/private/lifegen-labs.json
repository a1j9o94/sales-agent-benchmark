John is on the Billing operations team, Special projects, when we talk about documentation and training, they're talking about those team there. Creating information creaeting things that are streamlining peoples processes\n\nWe have a lot of documents nuanced information that's storing in whimsicle, leveraging all the existing resources\n\nA lot of talented people who are using teams to solve problems, potentially gather that information, there are these places that we can point to, gather information for here.\n\nThere's a lot of tie in to the rest of the company, other things they're considering. Operationally if we can connect to CRMPlatform, give me information about this building without having to go in to CRMPlatform, [Monday.com](https://example.com/... is very much a task oriented tool, you have to go and search for that information, find the information, give me the information this building, this customer without me having to do this time digging\n\nLooking at another customer they go from a permissions level, knowledge is the main thing, it can read through PDFs, excels and word docs\n\n**\n\nThey currently have an API\n\nWhimsicle, Sharepoint, [Monday.com](https://example.com/... James be very valuable to connect in to, when you have an updated information can agent go in and build it as well. Does AutomateFlow have a log of the tasks, that are being asked, what are these questions that people asking\n\n**Would want to FlowBuilder sure or review is being asked multiple times the same questions being asked over and again\n\nWith copilot you can specify which people can use\n\n## Full Transcript\n\n \nThem: Recording in progress.  \nMe: Yes. Hey, Paul. How's it going? You're muted.  \nThem: Yeah. Saw that as I was talking. I'm doing good. How are you doing?  \nMe: Doing good. Doing really good. Do you have a good New Year's Christmas holiday that you guys  \nThem: He was busy.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. We we also got pounded by the rain. So haven't  \nMe: Oh, this, like, this last couple of days. We're  \nThem: no. The during Christmas time. Luckily,  \nMe: think you told me last week. Oh, during Christmas.  \nThem: I'm in I'm in Southern California. So  \nMe: Oh, okay. No. You you aren't dealing with the storm, the the winter that was going on?  \nThem: no. No. We do have an office based out of Michigan. So  \nMe: This week.  \nThem: they are, however, getting pounded.  \nMe: Not too bad. Ethan. Great to meet you.  \nThem: How are you doing? Good to meet you as well. Thanks for having us. Yeah. I added a couple guys to the  \nMe: Of course.  \nThem: Alex. So Ethan's on our IT side and has a fair bit of knowledge in terms of what we're kinda talking about here. So  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: getting some different perspectives around the company. I think I'd added another team member from our billing team that's been kinda tagging along.  \nMe: Yeah. There was there was one more person. I saw was at oh, looks like they they didn't actually accept. It looks like they didn't necessarily accept the invite, though. So  \nThem: Okay. Yeah. I'll reach out to him and see if he's joining.  \nMe: they may or may not.  \nThem: Also, one thing that I personally was not aware of, interestingly enough, before we talked  \nMe: Oh,  \nThem: first time is we actually do use AutomateFlow. So as a company, we use it but for something else. So it's more so on kind of a technical alerting side. Of the house as opposed to what we're kinda talking about here.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Is more on kind of the the chatbot, the AI the the dataset. So and Ethan's kind of been helping us spearhead some of the different initiatives. I know we when we first talked, we're kinda testing out the Copilot version.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Some limitations on that, and we have a couple other demos that we've been working through. Realistically speaking, kinda what we're looking at from an overall goal and a standard One is, obviously, price point because I don't necessarily want to just open up a system where it's like, hey. You can ask as many questions as you want, but every time someone asks a question, it's a task. It's a it's a dollar and cents that  \nMe: No.  \nThem: isn't within kind of a a range point that we're okay with. But two, when we kinda talked earlier, all of our documentation and training and information  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: right now lives in a tool whimsical. And I know natively and and what we're hearing kinda in in the engine  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: there's not a whole lot of people connected to Whimsical. Yet. But we'd like to get there because the last thing we wanna do is then have to take from a tool we're already using. Put it somewhere else just to to get this work.  \nMe: That makes sense?  \nThem: So John, thanks for joining. John as well as been kinda testing different theories out scenarios out,  \nMe: And then, John, what what team are you on?  \nThem: and I'm on the billing operations so billing team under Paul.  \nMe: Phone number. Okay.  \nThem: But more so on the the the the black ops specialist projects type  \nMe: Nice.  \nThem: situation. When we're talking about documentation and training, it comes from  \nMe: Sense.  \nThem: those guys there. So, really, why this is an important tool is they put a lot of time and effort into creating these documents, creating that information set, creating things that are help supposed to help streamline people's processes, but people can't find it or people don't know how to s or question. And so that's what we're solving for, at least to start. So if you have anything you maybe wanna touch on, show, communicate to us,  \nMe: Well, I I did want to, like, talk a bit more about the, like, actual use case that you guys are talking about. Because, like like, mentioned, I did some searching as well, like, you'd flag whimsical isn't something that is already integrated. So this is one of the things where it's gonna be really dependent on, like, how the API specifically looks. What, like, what those that connection looks like. But the overall flow of what you're describing of, like, hey. We have this database of quest or database of knowledge that we wanna FlowBuilder sure is available to people so that people can ask us questions, whether that's in TeamChat or if we have, an email or whatever sort of the right motion is that we can respond to that with our knowledge base and then just raise it to the team when something is outside. Of that versus having to someone respond to every every single response or waiting when the information is actually there and available for you guys. So one, wanted to FlowBuilder sure I understood kind of that overall flow. If you could sort of describe that to me, how it works today. And then two, I'd started to put together just sort of like a list of like, hey. Here are some use cases, some value that we might be able to, like, tie to those use cases, which I think James help us build the case around, like, okay. It actually makes sense to, like, implement this more broadly across the org versus have this sort of one narrow specific use case that we're driving towards. Were kind of the two things I wanted to specifically get out of the conversation. Today. Does that is that kind of in line with how what you're hoping to get out get out of this?  \nThem: Yeah. I I would say based on kind of our the objective we're trying to reach is one, to to Paul's point, we have a lot of document. We have a lot of Nuance information that we're, you know, storing in whimsical that we want to be able to crawl and help the team get information faster based on all the all the documents that we've created. Leveraging all of that existing resources. Right? Another one is we have a lot of talented and smart folks that are using Teams right now to kind of message their their knowledge, their expertise, to solving problems, and potentially being able to gather, you know, gather kind of information, crawl that information so that team members, if they have a question on something specific or something nuance or even something general, that there's these places that we can point to and say, hey. Gather information from here. Gather information from here.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I think what a a lot of times what we're looking into is is is it's one or the other or not you know, not overall. So that that's kind of the objective that we're looking for at least from the billing the billing side. The billing team side. Yeah. And more robustly just to kinda tie on top of that is obviously John is very much billing related, billing focused, but there's a lot of tie in to the rest of the company and the way that they operate. Other things that we're looking at and considering and I know Ethan's got his kinda IT way of thinking about things. Operationally, obviously, if we can connect to things like CRMPlatform. Give me information about this building without having to go necessarily into CRMPlatform. The data, go search for it, find it.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So tying some tools together, the other one being monday.com. Monday.com, very much task oriented tool. That does impact three, four different teams. That works great. For what it does. You have to go and and search for that information find the information, be in the right place, opposed to having one place that I can say, okay. Give me the information for this building, this customer, this contract. And it sends it right back to me without me having to do extra time digging. So that's another kinda use case where  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: looking at, more high level. But if if we can solve for the small and then build on top of that, okay with that as well.  \nMe: Yeah. I mean, and I think just for full transparency, that's typically what most of our customers do. It's like they'll have, like, hey. This is the most important which it sounds like it's it's that whimsical response. Like, do we get this information from whimsical into the hands of our team in a way that is, actually helpful, useful for them to FlowBuilder decisions. Then on top of that, you're like, okay. We have AutomateFlow in place. The team is getting some value out of this. What are, like, the other sources of data? So I think like, I forget John or Ethan, one of you were saying, like, how do we pull from Teams? Then we can connect to CRMPlatform, Paul, as you were talking about. Then we can connect to monday.com. But it's it is helpful once you have, like, that first one done, then you're like, okay. These are the structures that we need. These are the places that people actually do engage with, and that that second, third, fourth one are often much, much easier than that. Initial. But it's helpful to have a plan because what we often see trends the other thing we often see is people are almost, like, not ambitious enough about what they can accomplish. So so it'll be like, Like, we'll start on we'll start on whimsical. Let's say for the sake of argument, like, we let's scope it. Like, oh, we think it'll take us two months. You'll work on it. It's, like, actually a month that it takes you. Right? And so we need to have the second, third, fourth things lined up so that you kinda sorta have that runway of things to work towards.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: If that makes sense. Okay. One thing I would  \nThem: And to add the add to it the we're looking more for it the the bot to be able to almost use it as, like, a knowledge base  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: documents that were taught, like, what what we're reading. It's not I'll have more questions from, like, my side of things where to see if, like because full transparency, we've been looking at another platform that's more IT based, but they kinda go from a function of an IT, like, permissions levels, and we don't really need that  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like, I I would love that. So if you know, AutomateFlow also can do permissions, then I'd love to talk about that at a at a later point. But knowledge is just, like, our main thing where it can read through what PDFs excels and and Word docs, and go through. And it looks like when I'm reading the whimsical API there, they currently have an API in beta, and it looks like all the files return is  \nMe: Let's  \nThem: HTML, which I take it would be fine for it. So  \nMe: fine. Yeah. Yes.  \nThem: I don't know if you guys have, like, a custom way to do, like, a custom API. Or if it would have to be something that you guys have to technically create first before we can use it.  \nMe: No. So if they have an API, we we do have custom APIs, and what we'll often see is customers James and, again, in your case, what we'll call, like, a custom action where depending on what the service model is, either, like, someone on your side or, like, someone on our side can, like, build it for you. So then it just shows up as, like, a whimsical step. That you that you or other people on the team can use. The other thing I want to flag as well, just in don't have go down this rabbit hole, but we do have, like, really, really robust permissions in place. So things like, hey. Only certain people can connect to these specific apps or if someone is starting creating an automation connected to these tools, we need a human to approve it. Like, those types of things, And all the, like, reporting and all that stuff, I can share those details with you, Ethan, as well just so you, like, have that, knowledge. And we should maybe have a conversation around, like, what's are the specific security requirements that you guys have. But just wanna know that all of that is there. As well.  \nThem: Oh, and also sorry.  \nMe: Okay. And I guess yeah.  \nThem: One more. Where does the bot live? Like, can we connect it to Teams and they can talk to it as, a chatbot or, like, a user? Or does it have do they have to go to and sorry. Is it it's AutomateFlow?  \nMe: Yeah. Yes. AutomateFlow. Happier.  \nThem: They can okay. It's AutomateFlow. Okay. So they can go into Teams and message it. They don't have to go to AutomateFlow's website and talk to, like, the chatbot in there.  \nMe: Correct. Correct. So our Tapbox work a couple different ways. So they're  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: there's the one where it's like, hey. You have a URL. Go to that chatbot and just talk to it. The other is, hey, we wanna connect this. Actually, like, let me show you. And so just talking about it, we can at an example.  \nThem: Awesome.  \nMe: So for this case, let's looking at a chatbot Scratch those really internal support. That's your URL. Right? Ggenia.com?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: This part isn't super important, but it does, like it it James just, like, pull from your basic website to the brand colors and all that. Are aligned. No. I'm gonna get a trampons. Here we go. And then so this here. And sorry. I didn't mean to jump, but this is, like, is sort of, like, the chatbot interface Right? You give it the basic instructions. You have sort of, like, what is the knowledge base that you're going to include. Where are the other So over here, we can, like, add sources and be, like, web pages specific files. Google Docs, DocSpace. And it seems like Ethan, from what you were saying, this might be, like, a file setup where it's, like, a maybe a folder where you drop in some of the when school had we had forgot, like, the specific logistics of that. But  \nThem: Yeah. So  \nMe: public URLs, Go ahead.  \nThem: what what it would be is, technically, it would never be and this is where it we we've kinda run into a difficulty with, like, the other team. We're looking at another one that has, like, a knowledge base, and they have to do it through. So we do both SharePoint and Whimsical, and they have to do it through a Microsoft Graph API.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: To get the SharePoint documents. So do you guys support SharePoint as a knowledge source? Or no?  \nMe: I think so. Full transparency, get you're getting into the level of technical detail where I wanna pull in one of our solutions architects to start talking about like, hey. Mechanically, how do we get these connected?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I do know that we do have customers who use SharePoint.  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: I would not, off the top of my head, like, know how that connections work, if that makes sense.  \nThem: All good? Yeah. We probably we probably wanna go down that route. Alex, get to that level.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Looking at the system and just kind of our our diligence on checking out systems is obviously we we feel like you guys have a good system. It's just a matter of whether or not it fits for our needs, and and it gets us to the we need to. Because we're we're in in the full weeds  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: testing everything, nothing has quite gotten us to the place that it does everything we're asking it to do. And I would hate for Ethan to have to have one tool, us to have a different tool on the operation side. And then finance comes back or product comes back. And and uses it a certain way. And plus, we already use AutomateFlow or AutomateFlow for part of our operations. So if we can have one centralized tool it would be ideal, but we need to FlowBuilder sure that it works from a  \nMe: I can't I can't actually do the things  \nThem: functionality. Correct.  \nMe: makes that makes a ton of sense. You Definitely happy to happy to pull in a solutions architect on our side. I guess what would help me be able to do that is if we could align on sort of like a preliminary, what I like to call go live plan it's like, hey. If I'm gonna start pulling in, like, technical resources from our side, are we when would you like to have something like this live, and how do we work backwards from going live to, you know, your our first sort of technical meeting. With the assumption that, you know, there James be gates, checkpoints around, like, are we actually hitting these requirements? Ethan, to your point, are we hitting the security requirements that that you guys need? And if I I can share a draft of that, but, like, if we could align on high levels, like, okay. We're aiming to go live at, like, the March or something like that, and we could work backwards from there. That would let me, pull in some technical resource from our side. You can, like, answer some of these, like, more detailed questions and even maybe do, a working session or two to actually get some of this stuff connected.  \nThem: I mean, I think if we find something that works, we wanna get it up in live fairly quickly. The other thing I'll say is we're already a customer. So technically, it's not not so much that we're we're not gonna pay for servicer go forward. From a sales standpoint. So I would say if we can actually get that technical discussion, that way we can actually assess whether or not it does what we do.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then that'll allow us to FlowBuilder that decision, determination how quickly we can do it. Because spent about a month on using testing Copilot, testing these other tools. I think we're narrowing it down to where we're gonna go. And and if we can find that tool that does what we needed to do, we're gonna move quickly.  \nMe: That makes that makes some sense. Okay. So then yeah, super tactically as a next step, I can loop in one of our solutions architects. Let's talk about if you don't mind me asking, like, who else are you comparing to? Like, for example, we often see, like, IntegrateHub and ADN. There are often people who are were being compared against  \nThem: It's so for, like, internal stuff and what  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Paul and John have been working on, it's been strictly Copilot. Which is, like, the the name when we're all in SharePoint. It's just start saying with Whimsical. Is Copilot so locked in Microsoft that you can't use Whimsical on top of that?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: The one that I've been demoing, which is for sure, like, more an ITSM instead of  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: know, a knowledge thing, is it's called Serval. It's, like, a little bit of a smaller company. But they are more based from a perspective of, like, everything's a ticket. So whenever you open a request or you talk to the chatbot, it is technically a chatbot that's responding to you, but it's opening that as a ticket. So you know, it it's good for me, but I was trying to say, oh, well, hey. They're connecting to whimsical. They're connecting to SharePoint, and they can pull I think it's PDF, PowerPoint, or sorry. PDF if the text is embedded. PowerPoint,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Word doc, Excel, they can read all of those files, and then you can talk to the chatbot about it. So SharePoint or I'm sorry. Got too many different Copilot works pretty decently with SharePoint, but the issue we're running into is whenever someone talks to it, they have to configure their permission set  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: to the bot. It'll be like, hey. I can help you with that, but you gotta approve it first And if they don't have access to one of those files because everyone in this call, we have pretty high sets of permissions when it comes to, like, the levels.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We test it, and it's like, oh, it's working for us, but then we go send it to someone and it doesn't work. So  \nMe: We can't get it. Yeah.  \nThem: yeah, so we want something where we can just upload our knowledge base with the documentation, with the folder structure, kinda like how Servo has it where I just go and it scans our whole SharePoint, and it's like, hey. These are your files. So I have Paul and John's folder selected in SharePoint. And then it goes through and it reads based off of that.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: So that's one thing. Another thing that slightly scares me with, like, looking at the screen is the storage. We're totally gonna go above that when it comes to our files. So I don't know how you got which I guess this would be something with the with the solutions guy, would be is it stored on your guys' stuff? Like, does SharePoint download to you guys and then you Okay. Cool.  \nMe: So no. And for something like SharePoint, that would not be actual stored on our side. The storage would be like you're actually uploading document specific  \nThem: Incredible.  \nMe: to here. And so that that makes a ton of sense. And could you just  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: to me a little bit? What are what are sort of the other, like, hey, must haves here? So it's connect to wins at the goal, connect to SharePoint, I imagine there's, like, at least some minimum level of security requirements, like, since you guys are already a customer, that's probably not as big of a deal, but what else is, hey. These are the things we have to hit for, a solution for this to be actually useful for us.  \nThem: Yeah. At least, thank you for that, Ash. That that question. At least from our side, from a billing side and documentation side, what is the goal you've you've touched that? We've mentioned that many times. And then money.com. Money.com is one of those huge like, we use a lot of work list on it. It's it's it's it it James be a very, like, import not important, but it'd be valuable to be able to connect to connect into it because of all the information on it. Those are really two things that really, you know, comes to my mind when when it comes to, like,  \nMe: People must ask for any for example, we bring any.  \nThem: needs. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And I I had a couple  \nMe: I think so.  \nThem: questions on top of that from and, John, you you said Monday at com. Yeah. When you have a chatbot, is it a read only, or can you do a read and write? Like, how does how does that workflow work?  \nMe: So you're saying, like, the chat like, the chatbots we just looked at are, like, like, read only. So that is, like, you just have a person. What I think would what you're potentially describing is we do also have, like, agents that you can trigger from, like, a TeamChat conversation or even, like, in a chat. Could trigger an agent off of something like that. But, like, it would be  \nThem: Correct.  \nMe: maybe not a meaningful distinction, but the chatbot itself is not responding. But you can, like, attach other, like, actions to it so that people can do stuff with it.  \nThem: So as an agent, maybe our better direction than a chatbot. Can an agent act as a chatbot?  \nMe: It's oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: I was gonna say, does an agent act as a chatbot as well, but it can do more?  \nMe: Yes. So yeah. Exactly. You could have, like, you we and, actually, we have a lot of these in AutomateFlow where it's like, hey. There's a TeamChat channel where you, like, post a question an agent James respond, and it has access to the SharePoint. It has access to, like, sort of that whole thing. And you may also give it, like, a create a Jira ticket option or update a monday.com. I I know if they use tickets as the right word, but, like, update the monday.com ticket that's involved here.  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: So both of those are options. If you're if you're wanting people to be able to update stuff, I do think agents is probably the direction you wanna go over chatbots if that distinction makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. Because we're even thinking about connecting it to, like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: CRMPlatform as well. And we have kind of an update of information Can the agent then go into CRMPlatform, update that record, And then I know Ethan, we had talked about this as well. With Copilot, you kinda build all your own agents. And then you can specify which team or people can use certain agents. Can we do that with AutomateFlow where it's basically, I have an agent John on the billing side can use this agent, Ethan on IT side can use this agent. I can use a certain agent because I have more  \nMe: Permissions.  \nThem: access to certain things just, yeah, just as kind of an example. It  \nMe: Yeah. A 100%. And what what in practice, the way that  \nThem: yeah.  \nMe: James tactically work so there's a there's a couple different pieces of this. One, as as someone, like, building the system, like, for the people on this call, you can build agents, like, with permissions that are tied to your accounts. So if, like, you log in, the agent can have that connection. Separately, though, if I if you're talking about, hey. As an end user, like, wanna like, someone on your team is going to a TeamChat channel, responding, you would have to, like, set guardrails around what that person can and cannot do. And, like, that would be set up in the, like, the tools that you give the agent. So, like, you might give it a readmonday.com tool capability, but not a write capability. For the agent that you're making available to the cuss for to your team.  \nThem: Mhmm. And is that permission you can change permissions based off of a person, like Ethan, you know, I James probably have global  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: like, permissions to things. But then let's say we have, like, you know, someone that only should have a a specific set of permissions based off of, like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: their permissions on Monday because I would hate for someone to, like, be able to go Not that I I think we have anyone here that would do this, but, you know, in in case I know that accidents with AI can happen and things can get messy very quickly, and that's, like, one thing that like, it's kind of a worry with me is like, I wanna FlowBuilder sure that permissions are locked down to who actually has permissions to that because I don't want someone going to a Monday board and marking stuff as done that doesn't even have permissions to that board.  \nMe: Absolute so, yes, by default, you James only have access to the things that, like, you as a user do, and you can set up more strict rules around that. So, like, even if even if a user would have access in money.com to do those things, you can be like, hey. Before anyone starts a Zap, that triggers an a deletion of a of a, item, we it has to be approved by someone on our IT team. Or, like, someone on this call before that actually gets put out, for example.  \nThem: Okay. And sorry, two more things that and  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I don't know if I'm I'm jumping ahead, but I know that your guys' pricing structure is more based off of, like, an actions thing or I forget what or  \nMe: Yeah. Task.  \nThem: how does that yeah. Task. How does that with agents is one call and one chat considered a task, or is it  \nMe: So  \nThem: each individual thing that it has to do within that  \nMe: yeah.  \nThem: call? Let's say I wanna go adjust on my neighborhood. Is it opening Monday and then going to a task then adjusting that task? Is that, like, three separate tasks, or is that all considered as one?  \nMe: So that that would be three separate, and I wanna clarify something in prefacing with even think this is a little confusing. But the way our agents are it's a separate pool of tasks from sort of, like, our normal tasks. So you would say, like, hey. You know, we need a 100,000 tasks per month for, like, our normal usage. We need 50,000 agent tasks per month to, like, be able to, like, respond to those things. What we James what I think we're moving towards, is a world around, like, April, May where agent tasks just use, like, some incremental amount of task where it's like, oh, an agent task is two tasks. Example, because it are more expensive, like they have to do more turns for each of the that runs that they do. So short version, that is also tied to tasks. And it depends on, like, how many of those we expect to actually be using James tell us. What drives it. I also want to clarify one thing on price, particularly if you're, like, looking at our pricing on like, for the Teams plans that that are on the site. Those scale very differently than our enterprise options do when it comes to like, how many more tasks you can get. So, like, without getting into, like, specific numbers, we we we can go from, like, 600,000 tasks to, like, 1,200,000 tasks per year. We're only going up, like, $10-20K on a on a plan, for example. And so, like, there's lots of room, flexibility in terms of, like, what the right volumes are. The thing that drives price on the enterprise plan is transparently, like, it's like the platform fee. It's like, having the having a technical account manager who understands your business. Having all those controls that we talked about earlier. That drive the price more so on the enterprise plan.  \nThem: Yeah. I also had one question. Just just speaking of number  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: of tasks and really coming from a development and measurement standpoint, like, does does AutomateFlow have a log of, like, the tasks that are being asked and, like and and and and being just because I wanna I would be curious to see if, like, a team member is asking, hey. And that's a task. Right? And it's just and it's just like, you know, like, better usage of that task number. And also from a development standpoint, like, are these questions that are people asking?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: That are, you know, that are very similar to each other so that I can treat that as more of a development standpoint? So yeah, that log that I would, yeah, I would love to see that log eventually later down the road. So that we can utilize that as kind of our measurement tool.  \nMe: And then, honestly, one one thought I have is, like, super tactically, if you could you could set up another agent that basically, like, watches the the database of this agent's calls and says, like, once a week, give me a summary of all the responses that have come in here for example. That's something that we see a lot of customers do, but I'll FlowBuilder sure to note down as, like, one of the specific things we wanna FlowBuilder sure  \nThem: Or or review if questions are being  \nMe: the solution architect shows you guys.  \nThem: multiple times and the same question is asked over and over and over again because that would be a problem. Yeah. I don't I don't wanna don't wanna have 2,000 tasks of being the same questions over and over and over and over again. So, yeah, these are the things to think about in the future for me, at least in my head.  \nMe: Okay. This is  \nThem: Head.  \nMe: super helpful. I realize we're basically at time. I think the best next step here is for us to do a call with the solutions architect. I have a quite a lot of detail think, from this conversation around, like, hey. Here are the specific things we need to FlowBuilder sure work. Here's what we need to be able to show for you guys for this to be useful. Would next week work? How when are you when would be a good time for us to have this conversation? Conversation?  \nThem: Follow your lead, Paul. So you set up a time. I'll I'll follow you. Let me I mean, I think right now, probably my  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: best day is Monday afternoon. Because I think I actually have to go to the office next week. What time? I'm not sure. Let me find that. Okay.  \nMe: Well, would it be better actually, I'm just realizing on on our side, would the would the ninth potentially work? I actually we have our off-site next week. And so people James be around, but it'll be, like,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: spottier. Than we normally are.  \nThem: Yeah. Mean Yeah. I'm good with that weight.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I'll so I'll send an invite for the ninth at the same time. As the starting point. We can be flexible there are other things in the meantime. I'll bring the solutions architect to that conversation. And if there are other, like, key things that just as you guys are thinking about, ping me in the meantime, and I'll keep updated. Actually, sorry. One one more thing. Did want to just, like, preview before we drop it. I'll send this in the email. What would what would love to get your like, thoughts, reactions that I put together based off of some of the use cases that you guys told me last time or that, Paul, you told me last time. We'll update this based off of what we just discussed, but would love to, like, have you guys just take a look at this. Is this directionally correct if we're thinking about the value that this, like, drives for the organization? Wanna FlowBuilder sure we're starting to think about this now before we get to, like, the end. It's like, oh, like, does this FlowBuilder sense for us? Yeah.  \nThem: This would be the annual cost for using the chatbot?  \nMe: No. No. No. These are  \nThem: Oh, from the  \nMe: this is not cost. This is not cost. This is  \nThem: Oh, okay.  \nMe: this is my sort of, like, first pass at estimating what the value is for you guys as a business. Based off of the use case that you gave me.  \nThem: Yeah. So it's kind of the the rate of return of having something do something quicker than having a person do it itself.  \nMe: Exactly. That's that's the idea. And we just wanna FlowBuilder sure that, like, am I using reasonable estimates? Are these, like, way off? Is it half this? Is it double this? Just so we can get a sense of what this is actually worth for you guys.  \nThem: Yeah. I don't think we know have a great enough idea of what measurement of how many tasks we're looking at. In my mind, it's gonna be a a hefty volume, but how much like, is it 405 tasks are actually gonna save us an hour? Probably not.  \nMe: No.  \nThem: So I I think we'll have to do a little bit of thought behind that. Ethan, do you have how many  \nMe: Yeah. Absolutely. Oh, sorry.  \nThem: how many current tasks we're using? With AutomateFlow?  \nMe: I can I'll look into that because, actually, I did not before this call, I didn't realize that you guys  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: a customer that's prop that's on  \nThem: And when I reached out to you guys, I didn't either.

Because, like like, mentioned, I did some searching as well, like, you'd flag whimsical isn't something that is already integrated. So this is one of the things where it's gonna be really dependent on, like, how the API specifically looks. What, like, what those that connection looks like. But the overall flow of what you're describing of, like, hey. We have this database of quest or database of knowledge that we wanna FlowBuilder sure is available to people so that people can ask us questions, whether that's in TeamChat or if we have, an email or whatever sort of the right motion is that we can respond to that with our knowledge base and then just raise it to the team when something is outside. Of that versus having to someone respond to every every single response or waiting when the information is actually there and available for you guys. So one, wanted to FlowBuilder sure I understood kind of that overall flow. If you could sort of describe that to me, how it works today. And then two, I'd started to put together just sort of like a list of like, hey. Here are some use cases, some value that we might be able to, like, tie to those use cases, which I think James help us build the case around, like, okay. It actually makes sense to, like, implement this more broadly across the org versus have this sort of one narrow specific use case that we're driving towards. Were kind of the two things I wanted to specifically get out of the conversation. Today. Does that is that kind of in line with how what you're hoping to get out get out of this?"

We have a lot of Nuance information that we're, you know, storing in whimsical that we want to be able to crawl and help the team get information faster based on all the all the documents that we've created. Leveraging all of that existing resources. Right? Another one is we have a lot of talented and smart folks that are using Teams right now to kind of message their their knowledge, their expertise, to solving problems, and potentially being able to gather, you know, gather kind of information, crawl that information so that team members, if they have a question on something specific or something nuance or even something general, that there's these places that we can point to and say, hey. Gather information from here. Gather information from here."

So that that's kind of the objective that we're looking for at least from the billing the billing side. The billing team side. Yeah. And more robustly just to kinda tie on top of that is obviously John is very much billing related, billing focused, but there's a lot of tie in to the rest of the company and the way that they operate. Other things that we're looking at and considering and I know Ethan's got his kinda IT way of thinking about things. Operationally, obviously, if we can connect to things like CRMPlatform. Give me information about this building without having to go necessarily into CRMPlatform. The data, go search for it, find it."

Give me the information for this building, this customer, this contract. And it sends it right back to me without me having to do extra time digging. So that's another kinda use case where"

This is the most important which it sounds like it's it's that whimsical response. Like, do we get this information from whimsical into the hands of our team in a way that is, actually helpful, useful for them to FlowBuilder decisions. Then on top of that, you're like, okay. We have AutomateFlow in place. The team is getting some value out of this. What are, like, the other sources of data? So I think like, I forget John or Ethan, one of you were saying, like, how do we pull from Teams? Then we can connect to CRMPlatform, Paul, as you were talking about. Then we can connect to monday.com. But it's it is helpful once you have, like, that first one done, then you're like, okay. These are the structures that we need. These are the places that people actually do engage with, and that that second, third, fourth one are often much, much easier than that. Initial. But it's helpful to have a plan because what we often see trends the other thing we often see is people are almost, like, not ambitious enough about what they can accomplish. So so it'll be like, Like, we'll start on we'll start on whimsical. Let's say for the sake of argument, like, we let's scope it. Like, oh, we think it'll take us two months. You'll work on it. It's, like, actually a month that it takes you. Right? And so we need to have the second, third, fourth things lined up so that you kinda sorta have that runway of things to work towards."

Before anyone starts a Zap, that triggers an a deletion of a of a, item, we it has to be approved by someone on our IT team.

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "So that that would be three separate, and I wanna clarify something in prefacing with even think this is a little confusing. But the way our agents are it's a separate pool of tasks from sort of, like, our normal tasks. So you would say, like, hey. You know, we need a 100,000 tasks per month for, like, our normal usage. We need 50,000 agent tasks per month to, like, be able to, like, respond to those things. What we James what I think we're moving towards, is a world around, like, April, May where agent tasks just use, like, some incremental amount of task where it's like, oh, an agent task is two tasks. Example, because it are more expensive, like they have to do more turns for each of the that runs that they do. So short version, that is also tied to tasks. And it depends on, like, how many of those we expect to actually be using James tell us. What drives it. I also want to clarify one thing on price, particularly if you're, like, looking at our pricing on like, for the Teams plans that that are on the site. Those scale very differently than our enterprise options do when it comes to like, how many more tasks you can get. So, like, without getting into, like, specific numbers, we we we can go from, like, 600,000 tasks to, like, 1,200,000 tasks per year. We're only going up, like, $10-20K on a on a plan, for example. And so, like, there's lots of room, flexibility in terms of, like, what the right volumes are. The thing that drives price on the enterprise plan is transparently, like, it's like the platform fee. It's like, having the having a technical account manager who understands your business. Having all those controls that we talked about earlier. That drive the price more so on the enterprise plan."

What can they break it down.\n\nSharepoint would need to see a test of it to see what data is being outputed and what fits with it.\n\n## Meeting Notes\n\n### Technical Requirements Assessment\n\n- **Whimsical integration** — Custom API build needed using their beta API (returns HTML files)\n  - Stores knowledge-based documentation, SOPs, reference materials, guides\n  - Mostly text content with some workflows/diagrams\n  - API supports filtering by team/folder sections for permissions\n  - Need to confirm API token access since still in beta\n- **SharePoint as knowledge source** — Can pull files without storing on AutomateFlow side\n  - Permission controls available through folder-level access\n  - Need live demo to verify data output quality\n  - Goal: AI summarization rather than just file links\n- [**Monday.com**](https://example.com/... read/write** — Straightforward integration available\n  - Current AutomateFlow account already supports this functionality\n- **Microsoft Graph API** — No out-of-box integration\n  - Would need custom webhook/API connection for user provisioning, licensing, group assignments\n  - Not urgent requirement\n\n### Platform Capabilities Demo\n\n- Custom app development options:\n  1. Single-use webhooks for specific automations\n  2. Private integrations for team-wide reusable actions\n- AI processing through multiple LLM models (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Google)\n  - Can switch models based on complexity using branching logic\n  - Mini/nano models perform well for knowledge-based tasks\n- Permission controls via enterprise features:\n  - Restricted/allowed apps by team\n  - Read-only vs read-write permissions per user group\n  - Admin oversight through audit logs\n\n### Usage and Pricing Considerations\n\n- Current account: Teams 50,000 plan with significant headroom for testing\n- Task consumption: Each automation step counts as one task\n  - 8-step workflow = 8 tasks per execution\n  - Only charged when steps actually run\n- Enterprise upgrade required for full implementation\n  - Significantly higher cost than current plan\n  - Includes TAM support for hands-on building assistance\n- **Usage logging** — No built-in admin center for conversation analysis\n  - Can build custom logging to AutomateFlow Tables\n  - Scheduled AI reports for usage patterns and duplicate questions\n  - Data retention configurable (7-30 days)\n\n### Key Concerns and Limitations\n\n- **Permission boundaries critical** — Need department-specific access controls\n  - Finance drive restrictions essential\n  - Whimsical folder-level filtering dependent on their API capabilities\n- **Knowledge summarization priority** — Want AI analysis, not just file retrieval\n  - Must avoid simple “here’s the document” responses\n  - Seeking conversational knowledge extraction from multiple sources\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Sofia: Create SharePoint demo video during company summit week\n- Ethan: Contact Whimsical team for API access and filtering capabilities\n- Alex: Send pricing details and enterprise plan information\n- Team: Test [Monday.com](https://example.com/... integrations on current account (credentials via [user@user](mailto:user@user))\n- Schedule follow-up meeting week of February 9th for live demos and business case discussion\n\n---\n\nChat with meeting transcript: [https://example.com/... AI.ai/t/42d60fe6-86c0-411e-ae6a-7d81a1ecd223](https://example.com/... AI.ai/t/42d60fe6-86c0-411e-ae6a-7d81a1ecd223)\n\n## Full Transcript\n\n \nThem: Recording in progress.  \nMe: Hey, John. How's it going?  \nThem: Alex. How's it going?  \nMe: Pretty good.  \nThem: It's good. Almost Friday.  \nMe: Almost Friday. Very ending. We're we have our company summit next week.  \nThem: Oh,  \nMe: All gonna be in LA, which is gonna be a lot of fun.  \nThem: Oh, where are you originally from?  \nMe: Well, so I'm I have a couple of separate questions. I'm originally from, Augusta, Georgia.  \nThem: Oh, wow.  \nMe: It's like oh, wait. I'm just not on. Originally from Augusta, Georgia is, like, where I grew up. It's home. My family is there. But I'm right now in Austin, Texas is, like, where I live.  \nThem: Wow.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I was born and raised in Los Angeles, so I was  \nMe: Oh, very  \nThem: I was curious. Yeah. So it's gonna be fun. You guys are gonna have some good time over  \nMe: Oh, We're very much looking forward to it.  \nThem: there. Yeah.  \nMe: Hi, Sofia.  \nThem: Hello.  \nMe: Good to you.  \nThem: Hello. And let me just double check with my team. They should there you go. There's the there's Paul.  \nMe: And then they became Ethan also accepted the invite, I think.  \nThem: Right. Yeah. There you go. There's there's the party people.  \nMe: You just had to you just had to start talking bad about them, and then they and then they would  \nThem: Yeah. That's usually the way it worked.  \nMe: got none of the stuff John said about you guys was true. Don't kick the recording. Don't worry about it.  \nThem: Okay. Can't be hell it can't be held in the court of law. I didn't consent to this recording. Just kidding. Just kidding, guys.  \nMe: No. But I I appreciate you  \nThem: Makes just call the same.  \nMe: Oh, sorry. What was that, Ethan?  \nThem: I was, man. I know I was saying you already signed you for it when you got hired, John. I know all your movements.  \nMe: Awesome. Guys, thanks for thanks for taking the time to to join today. So we met was that literally yesterday, two days ago? Talked through some kind of the high level details. Wanted to pull in Sofia who is the solutions architect on our side, and she's gonna, like, actually help us be able to answer some of these, like, more detailed technical questions to understand, like, the actual capabilities where things James be difficult, where where this is, oh, really easy as for for us to do out of the box. All those types of things with an eye towards, like, hey. We just need to, like, determine yes, no as quickly as possible. Like, can we actually connect and do these things that you guys are trying to do? And running back through the list, what I have is sort of like, these are the key sort of technical criteria One is the Whimsical integration, which would require an API bill potentially Two is how we actually pulling in SharePoint knowledge sources into our agents AI steps. The monday.com read write, which actually I'm less concerned about that one. It's like a pretty straightforward process. Permissions controls for the different agents and then the usage logging to FlowBuilder sure you actually have tracking of volume. Those were kind of the five as I had is like, hey. These are the criteria we have to hit. For any tool that we're using. Anything I'm missing on that list that we wanna FlowBuilder sure is included.  \nThem: I have, like, an additional question, but it's not related to what Paul and John are wanting. It's just be, like, from my stuff and more with Microsoft Graph API. I don't know if you guys have a connection with that, but, like, read and write permissions on that if if you can, like, tell it to FlowBuilder a user or tell it to assign a license or stuff like that. It's completely separate, but I'm just wondering if you know, if if AutomateFlow or AutomateFlow can do that as well instead of you going with, like, another solution. So we  \nMe: I  \nThem: don't have a AutomateFlow GraphQL integration at the moment. What exactly are you looking to do with it? Pretty simple stuff. Just, like, kinda just being like, hey. I have a new hire that's starting Can you create an account, give it an email address that or, like, provide it an email address that it would need to create, choose the license, then add it to specific Microsoft groups. I know that the ground doesn't support distribution list, but, like, any three sixty five groups. If there's, like, an API for it, we could build, like, a custom connection similar, like, to what we'd have to do for Whimsical. But it's really just, like, dependent on if the graph QL, like, API supports it. Got it. Okay. Cool. But, yeah, we just don't have anything out of the box. No worries. Then  \nMe: That's okay. Oh, no. I was gonna I was gonna say we can take that down  \nThem: sorry. Sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. You can go.  \nMe: as like a something to dig into If you have, like, any details on that or, like, if if you could share some doctors after the fact, we could probably come back to you with, like, a more what would this what would this take?  \nThem: It's and and that's not even, like, urgent. I'm I'm just from another solution that we were looking at that we were kinda looking to combo John and Paul into. They supported that, so I was just wondering. But it's not it's not a big deal if it's not  \nMe: Yeah. And I guess I James hand it over to Sofia. Could you sort of talk a bit about our capabilities around both I guess what I what I would really love for you to talk about, one is, like, the custom, apps piece, like, what would it look like for them to build Whimsical? And then the other piece is gonna be the SharePoint integration and how we can think about getting knowledge from SharePoint into the AI tools. I think those are gonna be the two, like, biggest technical things that we would love to show to the team.  \nThem: Yeah. Let me share my screen just to you all something. Let me just get up our account. So regarding Whimsical, there's a few different options that can be done here. I guess let me take a step back. What were you looking to grab I know that the I was looking through their API documentation, and I noticed that there's the possibility of like, files, and then they get returned as HTML. Are these files like, a lot of diagramming, or, like, what exactly are you looking to adjust from there? Yeah. So I can answer that question. So for what we're so we're we're trying to do it from the billing side of from Whimsical is we we store a lot of our knowledge based documentation. Our reference information, how to's, guides, as as was it a SOPs? So all that information. So most of it is text. There are chances of workflows and diagrams like you've like you've mentioned. Not as many, but obviously, we don't wanna be limited to just documents if it's a possibility. Right? But, typically, all of our like I said, reference materials, documentation is utilizing Whimsical as a kind of our central hub. So that that is what we're trying to pull from a Whimsical standpoint of, hey. Like, how do I specific question of a document, and it just kinda crawls information in that and and pulls the right information or or or close to it. Right? So that's kind of one of them. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Okay. That actually really helps. Okay. So there are two options. I think the best one probably just for, like, the first use case of having those knowledge sources and having almost, like, a chat would probably be just to use what we call like, our our Zaps, our bread and butter. So I know that you all have like, you have a AutomateFlow account based on what I heard from the last call. Curious if you guys are all actually familiar, like, with how AutomateFlow works from, like, the Zap standpoint and everything like that. Have a good background there? Would you like me to walk through that too? No. Sad. Yeah. What was yes. It's it's our it's our first time hearing about Zen AutomateFlow to the point where it's like, oh, we're we're customers already? Like, that's kind of, like, the scale of that. Reached out from a sales standpoint looking. So we're on the side. We're looking a lot more for figuring out how to streamline our internal kinda operational processes. Because there's a lot of documentation, a lot of information all over the place. And and really trying to clue it all together. And we use a lot of different tools. And as you can imagine, you have a lot of tools. You have a lot of places to look for information. And then that's kinda where we're starting. And then potentially looking down the road of how do we link it to some of our tasks in monday dot com. Updating things, utilizing things, and and making it more streamlined CRMPlatform, pulling information. Pull me a contract, pull me a while we're billing, all of those things. So it kinda gives us that one agent feel. I can ask it a question, and it's gonna tell me from all of our different sources. At least the right information or where to go. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thanks for the context. Okay. So this is pretty much like our bread and butter of AutomateFlow. Pretty much our Zaps, but our first, like, tool, I would say, the platform is. I think what would be good is kinda just show you how this works. So we do have, like, this AI like, built in Copilot, where you can kind of describe what workflow you wanted to build out, what automation. This is actually used throughout the entire platform. So you can use it with, the other features that I know Alex kinda showed you. Your previous call. So, know, our agents, our chatbots, tables, our forms. Pretty much can use it throughout the entire platform. And you can talk back and forth with it. It can set up like, a starting point for you within your automation workflows. But just wanna just highlight what the AutomateFlow, like, workflow actually looks like. So everything's kind of built of triggers and actions. Triggers essentially allows you to start the automation flow. So what is actually gonna be setting up the trigger? Whenever x happens, start the entire flow. So in this case, we could say, like, if someone were to start a chat with our agent, if we were to receive, like, a message from TeamChat or from Teams, in a specific channel, then continue the automation. We have about this should be updated closer to 10,000 apps that are integrated. We have, like, the ones that come with AutomateFlow, like, our top apps that you see here. We also have built in tools as well. And then we also have the ability of you to create your own private connections. So for example, Whimsical right now is not a supported app that we have within our our library. But it is something that you can build or you know, your team. But there is something else I kinda wanted to call out, which is our built tool called our webhooks. This can be used kind of like an API where move y'all since my Zoom screen's covering. With the trigger, you would choose the trigger event. So you can catch a hook, which, essentially, we would give you a specific URL, and you would post some information to that. Or you can actually retrieve you know, or, like, send out an API call essentially, but we call them webhooks. Sorry. So what we would do is actually take the whimsical API and put it in here, and we would FlowBuilder an API call with, like, a polling request and and go out and and get that information. From Whimsical and get that returned. So we could do that, which would allow you to just have it within your automation flow. And have that be one single step to pull in information. Or, let me pull this up. We also have this entire dev platform. You can we'd, like, outline the steps that you would take to actually build out, like, a a private API. Integration for your team. So if if you had other integrations within like, multiple APIs that you wanted to use, you would follow probably this as the best option. And that you can create multiple triggers or actions or anything from Whimsical. Rather than having those single steps within the automation.  \nMe: And then this allows you and other people  \nThem: Alex, you're on mute.  \nMe: I was gonna add, this allows you and other people on your team to build on those going forward. So we might let's say, you have one TeamChat channel where they're responding to Whimsical based off of what your team's doing, but maybe a the HR team later wants to have a channel that's using stuff of a whimsical too. They'd be able to use these same actions that you guys have already made. For example.  \nThem: Yeah. It provides, like, a more user friendly experience for your other builders, especially if they don't know where to find, like, the API documentation. I would probably recommend going the route of, like, building a a private integration. For your teams. If, like, for example, you only needed to use Whimsical in one one specific use case, one specific automation, then the API or webhook option would probably be best within, like, the UI here. So what that would look like is in our actions, we would do, like, a webhook. We would do, like, a specific request depending on the API documentation. So, for example, let's do, like, a GET. We would put in the Whimsical API, endpoint and then any other kind of information that you would need, like, your authentication for the API call and so on and so forth. And then that information can be used in steps to be used, like, as a a knowledge source or you know, any anything that you really wanna do from, like, any any standpoint. So if I wanted to, I could even throw in that information to, like, a Google Doc or, you know, integrate it with any other app. When adding the steps. The additional steps. And you guys help set these up at first, or is this more so, like, here's the tool you guys can go and use it, and here's how it works? Yeah. So with the enterprise package, if you do continue on would always be here to help you kind of map out your your use case either in the through the evaluation process. And then, also, we do have a TAM team as well who is really helpful at helping with kind of brainstorming throughout, like, the life of your account. And helping you figure out, like, what the best way and best approach for building your specific use cases are. You're on mute, Alex.  \nMe: And also just to be sorry. I'm so sorry. Keep to FlowBuilder sure I'm not interrupting And also just to be, like, super explicit, the TAMs James help you build.  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: So, like, if you're like, hey. We have some ideas or not sure, like, how to FlowBuilder these connections. They'll, like, hands on keyboard, like, build build some these things for you, actually sit with you and actually get them set So  \nThem: Cool. I know that on your last call with Alex, you also talked about possibly going the agent's route for having, like, the the chat as a an option with your team members. The great thing about Zaps and like, this UI and workflow in particular is that have all these steps. We have these integrations. With all of these different apps, but we also have the option to integrate with different AutomateFlow products. So, for example, I wanna to bring in stuff from Whimsical. I made that API call. I could send any of the information, that I got returned from Whimsical, to a specific agent. So then the agent can go ahead and based on the prompt that I created or the prompt that I wrote, would take in all of that information from the API that was returned and then do x, y, and z with it. Look through it, read through it, get any of the information, and then return it back to the user. And that could be done within the agent itself, or you could have, like, an additional step that would go to, like, the team, Microsoft Teams, and we could use a specific action, like, sending a bot message, sending a channel message, sending a chat message, and passing in all of the information that comes from the API or the agent itself and whatever those AI steps do. And I guess one of the the bigger items with Whimsical and and the way that it's currently set up, it pretty much has every department as, like, one area. When we're doing a webhook, I'm assuming it just pings the entire system and would just data scrub everything in there. Is there a way that you're aware of? And I know it's kind of a newer API but, basically, to limit which information it targets. So if I have someone on our billing team looking for billing information, they go to the billing section. Finance, same thing. HR, same thing. Or would it try and pull from the entire dataset So that would really depend on the Whimsical API itself. And what it returns. If it allows or supports filtering, for example, if you had, like, specific tags or folders within Whimsical itself that were able to be passed in as a, like, a parameter through their API, then that could be filtered through. We one thing we could also do is have, like, an agent or even an AI step, which let me show you here, where if you were to ingest all of the say, you weren't able to filter through Whimsical, you would only you were only able to get every single file that's ever returned. We can have, like, a a a separate AI steps here where we can give it a prompt and say, like, this is the message that someone brought us. It's they're looking for specific things like, that are HR related or know, whatever is related to their department and then return all of the information that's relevant to them. So we have, like, our built in AI steps. Where we have a different a few different build modes. You have your custom prompts. We also have, like, extract, translate, analyze, which should be, like, really good quick actions to be used maybe in that step. And then we have, like, our different models here. So we connect with ChatGPT, Anthropic. Sorry. My Zoom screen is in front of in front of here. Anthropic, Google, and you're also able to bring in your own keys for those LLMs. But anything that you see here like, a lightning bolt can be used with your AutomateFlow account. I guess taking a step back, have you guys invested in an LLM platform? Were you looking to use your own key here, or were you looking to rely on AutomateFlow? Probably gonna be relying on. We only like, a maybe we do technically have, like, Anthropic keys already. I don't know if our dev team's gonna want us to be using their keys for this, but I I would say it probably James we'd be going through you guys which, I mean, when in your use cases because I'm still kinda fresh on the whole, like, knowledge of each model when it comes to knowledge based stuff. Do the mini and nano model models Usually, operate pretty well, like or if we were to use, like, a Haiku or something from Anthropic, are those pretty smooth? Or do they usually take a little bit of time? To respond? They're they're pretty successful. I actually just finished with another account that I was working with, and I think we ended up building their use case was so large. We built maybe 10 different prompts for one exact flow, and the flow takes about I think it was maybe 80 steps. Took about one to two minutes to complete. But since it's an automation, it's happening in the background, so no one actually knows what's going on. And we haven't seen any failures with how those models are working. For that specific use case. So they're pretty successful. I think it really depends on what you're asking for it to do, and that's what we're here to help with. We're you know, us, the TAMs, are pretty knowledge like, have a lot of knowledge on how to work best with AutomateFlow. And sometimes, like, you're you might be working with the AI prompts and giving them a lot of information. And we'll take a look at that and kind of give our recommendations on maybe this should be you know, split up into different steps, to kind of help get the best out of the platform. And does it by chance there's another thing that or another program that we're looking at where it can based off of the question that's being asked, it can use a specific model? Is it smart enough to swap models based off of what the task or it always gonna be one specific model? For this, it's gonna be one specific model. For this specific, like, built in AI step. Within the Zaps. But with our agents tool, it actually goes between a few different models to get the best results. Yeah.  \nMe: And I guess the other thing I'd add here, if we I don't necessarily know if we would need to do something like that, but if you wanted to, we could all you could always just add a filter  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: or, like, a they're not not filters. Our branch, for example, for, like,  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: have a have a small model, say how complex this question and maybe push push it to a higher branch if we think if we think we need to type thing.  \nThem: Gotcha. Yep. Yeah. This is, like, a very simplistic skeleton of just a few things that you can do within AutomateFlow. But we have a lot of like, flexibility. You can have different branches, different conditional logics, based on the different routes you wanna take. And since you're kind of setting up an automation, kinda only touching it once a few times while you're testing. But once it's actually published and ready to go, you're not gonna be in there much, like, altering it. So And I see you guys so whimsical is pretty similar to DocSpace in a sense. With your DocSpace tool, are you able to kinda do that filtering thing like we asked for? Like, it only goes to specific I don't know how what DocSpace's boarding is, but, like, only goes to specific note notebooks or specific groups or something or is DocSpace just, like, you know, everything at one time? Yeah. So let's look at DocSpace. It really depends on the app itself. And what the the actions that are set up for the app. So every app's have its own separate actions. For example, here, we have everything for DocSpace. You can add content to a specific page. Can create a page, retrieve a page. So let's say we were retrieving a page We would set up our account. We'll use this one. And then on the next screen here is where you're gonna configure it. So this is where you would actually do all of that filtering. What we do here is we ask for specific data. We can either get this from previous steps. So, for example, maybe we're pulling in, the page ID from a database and we're having that be dynamic based on, you know, what was triggered, who was chatting, or we could have it be static. We know it want it we want it to get this specific page every single time this automation is run. So we have a lot of flexibility here for the filtering. It really just depends on what's the use case and the needs. Okay. And Paul and John, I'll reach out to our whimsical guy to see if we can, one, even get the API token because I guess it's in beta. But, two, one information it provides if we can if it gives, like, a or something because we should be able to technically filter it like a yes or no if it's in this group, then reply with the same. If not, then so I'll reach out to them and see if it's something that we can get And then as we're kind of talking about this flow, and I guess it's me trying to understand. When we're talking about an agent, is when we set up an agent, do you set up multiple agents Is it one agent? What's kind of the recommendation for that? So we have one for one team? Or a different one for a separate team when this workflow comes in? Is it all just kind of filtered from what's pulled from Whimsical and then depending on the agent or who has the question, how does that all work? Yeah. So it really depends on how we wanna set this up or how y'all wanna set it You can have it be as free as you'd like, or if you'd want whenever someone asks a question within Teams, you could always respond with an initial you know, template. So for example, our help desk kind of does this here. If I ever have an issue and I need to go to our IT team, if I throw in whatever message I want in our TeamChat team, I always get the same response back. Of we need x, y, and z data points from you. So you can always have, like, a a generic message that's always sent as the first touch point asking for those specific pieces, and then that can be used, to do the filtering within the agent. So now that we got those those pieces of information, take those pieces of data very similar to this, put it into, like, this kind of filtering option, dynamically, and then do the the rest of the automation.  \nMe: Yeah. And I guess maybe more abstractly, to if we if we take, like, a slight step back from, like, this specific use case, I think the point I would love to get across is that  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: the it it's as flexible as you would like it to which is a good thing, but can also be a bad thing. So, like, for each of these questions, I and I because I don't I always, feel like, oh, we're like, we can solve everything. But, actually, it's, for each of these questions, like, it can do it. It's just a matter of, like, how do we actually want to sit down and design So it'd be a question of, like, when you guys are working together as we, like, get into the nitty gritty of, like, how do you want these flows to work? These are all all great trade off questions, but we could go either way, and the system is flexible enough to allow allow you do whatever works best in your kinda context.  \nThem: Yeah. Great point, Alex. Yeah. As mentioned, I love people to say I can do everything. We also try not to say we can do everything. So it's just we're just trying to clarify and also create some boundaries as well. To an extent, some of our file folders and we use SharePoint quite regularly. Would be linked to SharePoint. Well, we don't want people pulling from our finance drive. So there's there's definitely some kind of structure in there that that we just need to FlowBuilder sure is in and capable and and more confident and comfortable with that.  \nMe: Yeah. Maybe could we, look at a SharePoint? Because I actually think SharePoint would be a bit easier because I think you give people access to, specific folders, if I'm not mistaken, Sofia.  \nThem: Mhmm. Yeah. So let me show you SharePoint. It might be a little difficult since I don't have a specific account that I can actually connect to. We'll see if we have one that's already shared. And then is it based on the person that asked the question? So you basically ask you how to roll to each person? So Alex mentioned, there's a few different ways that you can go about doing this. It really depends on, like, what we decide as the, like, the use case. How we're gonna wanna do this. When you're setting up the actual Zap itself, though, when you're choosing an action, you're choosing one account, that you wanna connect to. So if you did want this one Zap to be used by everyone, I would recommend, like, setting this up for a specific like, admin who has access to all of the files that you wanna share with folks. So if not, then you would need to have a separate Zap for each team. So, like, if you only want the Zap to only have access to, like, the HR teams, you would set up their account here. But on the next step, I'll actually show you what we can do kind of as, like, an an option. So let's So we can search. We can find a file. Let's see if we can continue with this one. In in the configure, we can choose, like, the site, the folder itself specifically. And then we can choose, like, the name. Peer is kind of where we were gonna do that dynamic field as well. So if we wanted to, we can have, like, a checkpoint as a previous step of collecting that person's information. And then here, we would have, like, a that dynamic input of only get the folder because they were in a specific like, in a specific team. One great way to do that is with, like, a filter. So we could say, like, in this filter, only continue on and keep going through this step. If they're part of this specific team. We can also do something like paths where it's like, if we have you know, the set number of teams, HR, accounting, finance, whatnot, we can have it go down a specific route depending on what team that they're on. But the action itself would be connected to, like, an overall global source of information. It just won't keep going unless that checkpoint is actually passed. Any questions there? I think, Paul, our our better route with that is probably more to have different, like, agents in in teams that are based on the permissions of, like, those people, and then they're given a dataset because, like, I I don't know how much we're gonna be be able to limit. And then can continue or question now kinda looking at this page that you're currently on, and excuse my I don't know the lingo exactly that you guys use, but each of these steps is considered a like, commit. Because I know that, like, when you buy from you guys, it's like a 100,000 steps or or zaps or whatever it's called. Is this zap that we have created, is this considered one step, or would this be considered eight tokens each time that it's running this Zap? So it's every step Go ahead, Alex.  \nMe: I I well, I think we're about to say say the same thing. In this example, this would be eight this would have been eight steps.  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: You would consume, but you can have I guess this is potentially different than some of our competitors. You can have as many of these Zaps made as you want. So, like, for the sake of argument, let's say you you do think, hey. We need 10 separate of these agents built to, like, for p for different teams to be able to respond to. You can build all of those and only be charged for the actual throughput.  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: Through the system.  \nThem: Gotcha. It's only gonna be if it actually runs and if the the steps the subsequent steps run as well too. Okay. So, like, for example, that trigger could this, like, first step could happen, the trigger, but it doesn't actually continue because you had some kind of check checkpoint here. None of those subsequent steps are gonna count as tasks. At all because they didn't they didn't actually go through. Could gotcha. Oh, sorry. Could we potentially just just another question. Potentially, add different agents for different folders of SharePoint? So, like, for example, like, HR folder, a different agent for that. Billing operations, different agent for that. That way, just goes through one step each time. Just to kinda organize that, and that would help with the permission stuff too. Right? So that's kind of my thought process. Okay. Yep. That would be, like, that path option that I was kind of highlighting here. Yeah. And then, I guess, when we're talking about kind of the price point, obviously, the number of that happen. If someone asks a question and it pulls from Whimsical, pulls it to the level, the agent responds with whatever that information is. Someone asked a clarifying question. Does it go back from the agent all the way back to the beginning, or does it just go agent and back? Like, is that another two tasks, three tasks, four tasks? How do how do we think about, like, total number of tokens to that extent? Yeah. So that's that's the really difficult part. That would actually probably be a completely different Zap itself. So this is probably gonna be the setup for getting all of the information that you want, and maybe we'll only flow if you actually need some some files returned. If someone had, like, a just a separate question, they might go through a different SAP and a different step or solution, or we could even FlowBuilder it be branch of this Zap where it says, like, hey. I received an additional message. Do I need to get another file? Go down this path. If not, like, you know, maybe use a separate AI tool to to get a response, and then it would kind of go back and loop through every single time. So it really depends on, like, route they're gonna take. Are they actually getting more information, or do we just have to keep going back and forth through dialogue? Yeah. And I I imagine It's really hard to I was gonna say, it's just it's just really hard to calculate. Because you don't know how long the conversations are actually gonna And and I was gonna say, Paul, I'd imagine if it's crawling the document, it's like, if you ask clarifying question on that specific document, I'd imagine it didn't it doesn't have anywhere else to go because it's pulling from that straight document. It's not like it's gonna be like, oh, let me clarify this for you and try to find some similar document. And try to FlowBuilder it so I I that's kind of, like, what I'm thinking. From from this kind of scenario. Right? So Yeah. I'm just I'm trying to think of all the outside cases that returns a wrong document. Yes. It's Yeah. Question again, and then it has to go find another document after that. Perfect segue. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Gonna say we also just have, like, fallback options within our pad as well. So for example, I just worked on another use case where we set up something that we call request for approval or human in the loop, which allows you to not allow the Zap to kind of keep going over and over again. Because we wanted to have an escalation point. So maybe someone just, like, isn't getting anywhere. For example, like, that help desk option I shared about our our IT team, there is an option there that says, like, do I wanna continue working with this AI chat, or do I wanna escalate and get an agent like, actual team member looking at this? Yeah. So there's also those, like, different points, of contact that you can get through to actually stop the flow. Yeah. Thank you for that because my I was gonna segue into one of the items in the the steps where the usage logging just so that I can we can kind of vet and FlowBuilder sure that you know, the same questions and just kind of the the constant, like, know, like, missed use of the the the tasks, should you say, can be kind of seen as more of a, a yeah. Yeah. I just wanna see if there's a usage log what kind of questions are being asked, That way we can see, like, oh, this one person asked a 175 different questions, but it's the same answer over and over and over again. Right? So so that we can kinda stop that from from a, you know, like a accountability standpoint kinda thing. So I just wanted to see if there's anything like that. Yeah. So we don't have, like, a would say, like, an admin center that's gonna do, like, an analysis of exactly what happens during those conversations. But I know Alex brought up a really good example, last time where you can kind of do something very similar to the chat here. Have a different automation flow for, like, a separate agent that's kind of doing that in the background. So with every single zap zap that's triggered or agent that's triggered, we could have, like, an integration maybe with AutomateFlow tables where it logs all of the the data that happened within the chat, how many messages were sent back and forth, what was the outcome of it, was it escalated or not, and then we could have it run on a schedule. Maybe every week, every month, you get, like, a a report that is analyzed through AI, through a separate agent, and lets you know how that's working. This admin center is really good for just understanding how how many, like, Zaps are running. So what your tasks usage is overall, what how, like, successful are your apps, Zaps that are running, and, like, what has aired out. We have, like, an audit log as well where you can see the activity of how often the automations have been running. But you won't get, like, that granular information of, like, who chatted here, who did that. Just because AutomateFlow is so flexible. Everyone's kinda doing something different with their automations. So this test kinda giving you, like, a high level overview. Of what's happening. Thank you.  \nMe: And the other thing I'll I'll add from, like, a I think this is actually a a conscious choice we've made from, like, a security standpoint is we don't necessarily keep the information that is, like, in the in the chats. Right? So, like, it James we have logs that say,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: the chat happened, but we're not storing the information that you actually putting through the system.  \nThem: Makes sense. We have this data policy here where, by default, it's set between seven, for thirty days, but you can also FlowBuilder this, as low as seven days. So if you wanted that data purged every seven days, you can update that here. Awesome. Thank you. Thing that I I tried to catch before we went away from the page, but looking at the SharePoint AutomateFlow step, Is that when when you have it pull that document, is it reading over it considered one, or then then do you need an a second step for it to read the document over to provide the information out of it? I have to double check. I can afterwards. I have to do some testing, but it I think it return all of that information to you, like, actual file. But if you wanted to, like, analyze it, that's probably gonna be an additional step. Like, if wanna to provide a summary or something like that. But if you wanted to just get the raw file itself and pass it on to another step, you wouldn't need any additional information. Got it. Okay. With tools like CRMPlatform and monday.com that we also use do you guys have a read write option? Mhmm. Yep. And I do wanna actually highlight our app permissions. So like I mentioned, admin center is kind of one of those enterprise features where you have, that dashboard we initially looked at, analytics and audit logs. But we also have a lot of governance fee governance features, which are really awesome. We have the two two kind of options here. We have restricted apps and allowed apps. So restricted apps means that no one is gonna be able to use those apps. You don't like, for example, you might have your s three bucket. You want your like, no one to be touching this, no one to be able to, you know, use that even if they have a login. You just don't want your team actually having any automations there for security reasons. If we were to go to allowed apps, this is kind of the opposite. So it's saying which apps are allowed to be used by your team members, and it doesn't have to be all or nothing. So, for example, I'm gonna go into that s three exam everyone is only allowed everyone who has a a login to AutomateFlow, can only do these specific things. So they're allowed to get information but they're not allowed to write So I can restrict it so that they can read, but they can't write. But I am not doing this just for everyone. I also have, like, a another level here where I want a specific team to have restrictions that are allowed to write and read because they're on the solutions architect team. So this is the only exception to that everyone rule. And you build that team directly in here. So basically, you have a team and then you just assign people to it. We have our user management, so you can build a bunch of different teams so that you can control those app permissions. Cool. Know we have two minutes left, I believe. Wow.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. We're we're sort of we're this was up at time. I guess question I would ask is based off of what you've seen here, do you feel confident in, like, the technical capability? Obviously, there's a lot of work to do to, like, build it. But are there are there questions that you would need to answer to feel saying, yes, at least AutomateFlow can do the things that we need. Still.  \nThem: My main thing is because I know this wouldn't be a limitation from you guys. It'd be a limitation from the whimsical side is if they can break down specific documents because Whimsical's kinda similar to SharePoint in a sense where specific folders have specific permissions because they might have information that's, you know, a little more sketchy for other people to view. So I'd have to see if that  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: can break it down to a specific point, which I know wouldn't fall on you guys. SharePoint from a perspective too, I guess that's more of one that I feel slightly more comfortable on, but I would need to, like, see a test of it to see if what data is actually being outputted. Actually fits with it. So I'd probably don't exactly have a a straight answer until I find out with with whimsical if it seems like it could. I mean, it seems like it can do a bunch of things and we've kind of found with all these different programs that we're looking at that Google environments or usually have a little more access than the Microsoft environments do. So I guess we would just kinda need to see how it works if we were to plug in our stuff with it. Yeah. Actually, I just took a quick  \nMe: So then  \nThem: look at their documentation. It does seem like it returns a list and you can do filtering based on, like, a team section or a folder. So looks like you can do that filtering. Cool. And just a housekeeping question. Like, when connecting into the API of women's does it need a license? Does AutomateFlow need a Whimsical license to be able to pull that information in to as its own kind of user? We would need some kind of authentication if that API requires So y'all would need to to have that input, and we wouldn't share that with anyone. It would just be solely for your account and whoever actually has access to that specific Zap. So it doesn't need like, you could even build it privately so that only you, John, have access to that workflow. And else on your team can actually get those credentials because they don't have access to edit that. Workflow. Sweet.  \nMe: Yeah. So I just in terms of tactical next steps, it sounds it sounds like there's Ethan, you need to get in touch with the Whimsical team to see, like, what can they pull there. And then I guess I also heard it's it's like you would you wanna actually see something around SharePoint. Like, it it's like it sounds like you, like, theoretically agree it works, but you would need to, like, see it like, an actual flow before you feel fully confident there. Is that fair?  \nThem: Yeah. I'm just my my main thing and I I don't know if this is even a a possibility and even in the AI world that we're we're living in at the moment, but our our kind of goal that we're looking for is less for it to be like, hey. I found this file. Here you go. And then you go read the file. We're looking more for it to, like, have a knowledge source that it can now provide that information to you. In a summarized result. So I would need to kinda just see. I know that everything can be tailored a million different ways. So, like, you know, we we would have to require some testing. But, yeah, I guess that's kinda what I would wanna more just see because if it's just providing a link to a SharePoint, then I'd rather people just use a search bar instead of doing that. But if we can find a way where it can, like, summarize the data that it's actually reading, then I I think that's something that we'd be looking more to do.  \nMe: Sofia, let me ask you this. Would it be FlowBuilder sense maybe to do, like, a working session does that is all we were a little bit ago?  \nThem: Yeah. I was gonna offer we could do a working session. We do have, like, our company, like, summit next week. So asynchronously, what I can do also is I can kind of work work on a, like, quick little demo and send you a recording as well just to show you how I can pull some information from SharePoint, how AI would kind of analyze that and send that over to just so we don't lose momentum. Yeah. We definitely wanna see some use cases, obviously. It sounds great in theory. But theory is only one thing. We we do wanna see that it can grab something I can ask it a question from CRMPlatform. It'll grab either a contract or a a number or a person or information from that. Same thing with Monday. If I can link it back to a Monday board, all of our tasks oriented, kind of focuses through that system. It's just thinking about all of our diff different systems and not having to go find it necessarily. And then to Ethan's point, it doesn't just tell me to go back to this board or tell me to go to this document. It actually gives me what I'm asking for. That's really where we're gonna start to see a lot more value and efficiency gains from our team. Yeah.  \nMe: Thanks to how's that Okay. So then  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: it sounds like one next step Sofia, you James put on putting together, a video demo for them next week. Do we want to have a meeting maybe I think originally we were talking about, like, the ninth post that week. So where where we can actually talk through some of those examples And then, honestly, one potential might frame this as, like, homework for you guys, which might be helpful. Since you have the AutomateFlow, like, account in your system, particularly on, like, the monday.com sales ones. I would encourage you just to, like, play around with those because, honestly, that is, like, one of the easiest use cases that we have people try. We can definitely, share show some of those like next time we have meet 100%. But I would honestly encourage you just, like, go in, actually, like, play around with it because that is one of the ones that I think is easier rather than harder for some of these  \nThem: Do you know what size account we're on right now?  \nMe: You're on a, Teams 50,000 plan.  \nThem: Okay. Gotcha.  \nMe: Yeah. So you have you actually have quite you have quite a lot of headroom just in terms of, like, task size even within your current plan that you could just start using and testing some of this stuff. On.  \nThem: It's good to know. Ethan, do you have a login? We'll log in as we speak and scroll through the one password. But, yeah, I can I can look that off off call and and see if it's something that I mean, I know that I have credentials somewhere? It's just figuring out which ones they are.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then, Alex, probably what makes sense from the way I'm looking at it too is obviously, we need to test out and see what kind of where you're talking about is room, wiggle room we have in the current plan.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Additional plans, what step ups look like, what kind of the different pricing options is, and then what might FlowBuilder sense if we go to enterprise enterprise route, what that does, what that entails.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: If you can help me with that information, that way I can start to put together basically, the the business case and use case  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: still need to sign off from the CFO and CEO, but because we're already using it, it's just a matter of, is it incremental? Is it a lot more? Is it  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: and what that all means.  \nMe: I I'll care more details, but just transparently, it is significantly more than what you guys are paying today. Just like the the enterprise plan, it's the task are part of that, but really you're paying for, like, Sofia's time and for, like, the time that Tams and, like, the part  \nThem: Yeah. Of course.  \nMe: So, we'll happy to share some of those details. We just wanna, like, let sort of set expectations. It's not going to be in the same  \nThem: Yeah. Appreciate that. And and we'll look at that. I mean, we have a lot of people, like, John and Ethan here that are willing to do things. I'm but I also wanna see if I don't have to put their  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: time against something like that. What would that additional cost look like?  \nMe: Makes the tonsils. Okay. That sounds great. I James, send a a hold for us to meet up on the week of the ninth. And I'll send a calendar. I'll send a email, follow-up with just all the details we discussed here and, lay out sort of the tactical next steps. And I'll plan to come to that call at the ninth with, like, some specific details around  \nThem: And then if Ethan can't find the the  \nMe: like, price points that we can share with you guys.  \nThem: the login, are you guys able to help us with one of those?  \nMe: I can what what I can do is probably I can point you towards the who owns it now. I guess trans  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: ly from if you could if you could get me on the call with someone who owns it now, I could get you one, but I can't like, send it without, like, an email from that person.  \nThem: Can you give us a if you can give us a name of the person, we'll go.  \nMe: I love those. I just have to look that up. One moment.  \nThem: Yeah. If you can give me the email, then I James figure out how to get into it. Yeah. Unless it doesn't work, then I'll Does it say get LifeGen Labs on it? Because then we know for sure it's one of ours. Yeah.  \nMe: I know. It's not LifeGen Labs. It's in that  \nThem: Oh,  \nMe: with me. It it's the  \nThem: I see.  \nMe: it was the it's the company you guys  \nThem: Is it secure? Oh, it's secure. Yeah.  \nMe: It's like user@user or something like that. But one moment,  \nThem: Okay. How'd we let that happen, Ethan? Thanks. That was before my time, man. That's what I've done. I'll figure out again, though. I have a I have a secure. Email so I can can get into it. Awesome. Cool, guys. Well, thanks for your time. I appreciate you guys going over time with us. It's it's been informative, and I hope that we can  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: test this out on our current plan and see if it kinda works how we're anticipating it to work. Work.  \nMe: Awesome. And I'll I'll I'll send this over right after I just need to, like, actually find the details on it. So do something. I'll send that to you. But then we'll get you connected. We can do some testing, and let us know if you have questions before our next follow-up call. But  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: appreciate it, guys.  \nThem: So much, guys. Hope you guys have a great summit.  \nMe: You too.  \nThem: Yep. Everyone. Thanks.  \nMe: Have a great  \nThem: Bye. Have a good day, guys. Bye. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/2004dd97-893d-4e6e-ab19-17a98483a6f0](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/2004dd97-893d-4e6e-ab19-17a98483a6f0)\n",

Wanted to pull in Sofia who is the solutions architect on our side, and she's gonna, like, actually help us be able to answer some of these, like, more detailed technical questions to understand, like, the actual capabilities where things James be difficult, where where this is, oh, really easy as for for us to do out of the box. All those types of things with an eye towards, like, hey. We just need to, like, determine yes, no as quickly as possible. Like, can we actually connect and do these things that you guys are trying to do? And running back through the list, what I have is sort of like, these are the key sort of technical criteria One is the Whimsical integration, which would require an API bill potentially Two is how we actually pulling in SharePoint knowledge sources into our agents AI steps. The monday.com read write, which actually I'm less concerned about that one. It's like a pretty straightforward process. Permissions controls for the different agents and then the usage logging to FlowBuilder sure you actually have tracking of volume. Those were kind of the five as I had is like, hey. These are the criteria we have to hit. For any tool that we're using. Anything I'm missing on that list that we wanna FlowBuilder sure is included."

It's completely separate, but I'm just wondering if you know, if if AutomateFlow or AutomateFlow can do that as well instead of you going with, like, another solution. So we"

I know that the ground doesn't support distribution list, but, like, any three sixty five groups. If there's, like, an API for it, we could build, like, a custom connection similar, like, to what we'd have to do for Whimsical.

And then the other piece is gonna be the SharePoint integration and how we can think about getting knowledge from SharePoint into the AI tools. I think those are gonna be the two, like, biggest technical things that we would love to show to the team."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. Let me share my screen just to you all something. Let me just get up our account. So regarding Whimsical, there's a few different options that can be done here. I guess let me take a step back. What were you looking to grab I know that the I was looking through their API documentation, and I noticed that there's the possibility of like, files, and then they get returned as HTML. Are these files like, a lot of diagramming, or, like, what exactly are you looking to adjust from there? Yeah. So I can answer that question. So for what we're so we're we're trying to do it from the billing side of from Whimsical is we we store a lot of our knowledge based documentation. Our reference information, how to's, guides, as as was it a SOPs? So all that information. So most of it is text. There are chances of workflows and diagrams like you've like you've mentioned. Not as many, but obviously, we don't wanna be limited to just documents if it's a possibility. Right? But, typically, all of our like I said, reference materials, documentation is utilizing Whimsical as a kind of our central hub. So that that is what we're trying to pull from a Whimsical standpoint of, hey. Like, how do I specific question of a document, and it just kinda crawls information in that and and pulls the right information or or or close to it. Right? So that's kind of one of them. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Okay. That actually really helps. Okay. So there are two options. I think the best one probably just for, like, the first use case of having those knowledge sources and having almost, like, a chat would probably be just to use what we call like, our our Zaps, our bread and butter. So I know that you all have like, you have a AutomateFlow account based on what I heard from the last call. Curious if you guys are all actually familiar, like, with how AutomateFlow works from, like, the Zap standpoint and everything like that. Have a good background there? Would you like me to walk through that too? No. Sad. Yeah. What was yes. It's it's our it's our first time hearing about Zen AutomateFlow to the point where it's like, oh, we're we're customers already? Like, that's kind of, like, the scale of that. Reached out from a sales standpoint looking. So we're on the side. We're looking a lot more for figuring out how to streamline our internal kinda operational processes. Because there's a lot of documentation, a lot of information all over the place. And and really trying to clue it all together. And we use a lot of different tools. And as you can imagine, you have a lot of tools. You have a lot of places to look for information. And then that's kinda where we're starting. And then potentially looking down the road of how do we link it to some of our tasks in monday dot com. Updating things, utilizing things, and and making it more streamlined CRMPlatform, pulling information. Pull me a contract, pull me a while we're billing, all of those things. So it kinda gives us that one agent feel. I can ask it a question, and it's gonna tell me from all of our different sources. At least the right information or where to go. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thanks for the context. Okay. So this is pretty much like our bread and butter of AutomateFlow. Pretty much our Zaps, but our first, like, tool, I would say, the platform is. I think what would be good is kinda just show you how this works. So we do have, like, this AI like, built in Copilot, where you can kind of describe what workflow you wanted to build out, what automation. This is actually used throughout the entire platform. So you can use it with, the other features that I know Alex kinda showed you. Your previous call. So, know, our agents, our chatbots, tables, our forms. Pretty much can use it throughout the entire platform. And you can talk back and forth with it. It can set up like, a starting point for you within your automation workflows. But just wanna just highlight what the AutomateFlow, like, workflow actually looks like. So everything's kind of built of triggers and actions. Triggers essentially allows you to start the automation flow. So what is actually gonna be setting up the trigger? Whenever x happens, start the entire flow. So in this case, we could say, like, if someone were to start a chat with our agent, if we were to receive, like, a message from TeamChat or from Teams, in a specific channel, then continue the automation. We have about this should be updated closer to 10,000 apps that are integrated. We have, like, the ones that come with AutomateFlow, like, our top apps that you see here. We also have built in tools as well. And then we also have the ability of you to create your own private connections. So for example, Whimsical right now is not a supported app that we have within our our library. But it is something that you can build or you know, your team. But there is something else I kinda wanted to call out, which is our built tool called our webhooks. This can be used kind of like an API where move y'all since my Zoom screen's covering. With the trigger, you would choose the trigger event. So you can catch a hook, which, essentially, we would give you a specific URL, and you would post some information to that. Or you can actually retrieve you know, or, like, send out an API call essentially, but we call them webhooks. Sorry. So what we would do is actually take the whimsical API and put it in here, and we would FlowBuilder an API call with, like, a polling request and and go out and and get that information. From Whimsical and get that returned. So we could do that, which would allow you to just have it within your automation flow. And have that be one single step to pull in information. Or, let me pull this up. We also have this entire dev platform. You can we'd, like, outline the steps that you would take to actually build out, like, a a private API. Integration for your team. So if if you had other integrations within like, multiple APIs that you wanted to use, you would follow probably this as the best option. And that you can create multiple triggers or actions or anything from Whimsical. Rather than having those single steps within the automation."

They'd be able to use these same actions that you guys have already made. For example."

I would probably recommend going the route of, like, building a a private integration. For your teams. If, like, for example, you only needed to use Whimsical in one one specific use case, one specific automation, then the API or webhook option would probably be best within, like, the UI here. So what that would look like is in our actions, we would do, like, a webhook. We would do, like, a specific request depending on the API documentation. So, for example, let's do, like, a GET. We would put in the Whimsical API, endpoint and then any other kind of information that you would need, like, your authentication for the API call and so on and so forth. And then that information can be used in steps to be used, like, as a a knowledge source or you know, any anything that you really wanna do from, like, any any standpoint. So if I wanted to, I could even throw in that information to, like, a Google Doc or, you know, integrate it with any other app. When adding the steps. The additional steps. And you guys help set these up at first, or is this more so, like, here's the tool you guys can go and use it, and here's how it works? Yeah. So with the enterprise package, if you do continue on would always be here to help you kind of map out your your use case either in the through the evaluation process. And then, also, we do have a TAM team as well who is really helpful at helping with kind of brainstorming throughout, like, the life of your account. And helping you figure out, like, what the best way and best approach for building your specific use cases are. You're on mute, Alex."

          "text": "Cool. I know that on your last call with Alex, you also talked about possibly going the agent's route for having, like, the the chat as a an option with your team members. The great thing about Zaps and like, this UI and workflow in particular is that have all these steps. We have these integrations. With all of these different apps, but we also have the option to integrate with different AutomateFlow products. So, for example, I wanna to bring in stuff from Whimsical. I made that API call. I could send any of the information, that I got returned from Whimsical, to a specific agent. So then the agent can go ahead and based on the prompt that I created or the prompt that I wrote, would take in all of that information from the API that was returned and then do x, y, and z with it. Look through it, read through it, get any of the information, and then return it back to the user. And that could be done within the agent itself, or you could have, like, an additional step that would go to, like, the team, Microsoft Teams, and we could use a specific action, like, sending a bot message, sending a channel message, sending a chat message, and passing in all of the information that comes from the API or the agent itself and whatever those AI steps do. And I guess one of the the bigger items with Whimsical and and the way that it's currently set up, it pretty much has every department as, like, one area. When we're doing a webhook, I'm assuming it just pings the entire system and would just data scrub everything in there. Is there a way that you're aware of? And I know it's kind of a newer API but, basically, to limit which information it targets. So if I have someone on our billing team looking for billing information, they go to the billing section. Finance, same thing. HR, same thing. Or would it try and pull from the entire dataset So that would really depend on the Whimsical API itself. And what it returns. If it allows or supports filtering, for example, if you had, like, specific tags or folders within Whimsical itself that were able to be passed in as a, like, a parameter through their API, then that could be filtered through. We one thing we could also do is have, like, an agent or even an AI step, which let me show you here, where if you were to ingest all of the say, you weren't able to filter through Whimsical, you would only you were only able to get every single file that's ever returned. We can have, like, a a a separate AI steps here where we can give it a prompt and say, like, this is the message that someone brought us. It's they're looking for specific things like, that are HR related or know, whatever is related to their department and then return all of the information that's relevant to them. So we have, like, our built in AI steps. Where we have a different a few different build modes. You have your custom prompts. We also have, like, extract, translate, analyze, which should be, like, really good quick actions to be used maybe in that step. And then we have, like, our different models here. So we connect with ChatGPT, Anthropic. Sorry. My Zoom screen is in front of in front of here. Anthropic, Google, and you're also able to bring in your own keys for those LLMs. But anything that you see here like, a lightning bolt can be used with your AutomateFlow account. I guess taking a step back, have you guys invested in an LLM platform? Were you looking to use your own key here, or were you looking to rely on AutomateFlow? Probably gonna be relying on. We only like, a maybe we do technically have, like, Anthropic keys already. I don't know if our dev team's gonna want us to be using their keys for this, but I I would say it probably James we'd be going through you guys which, I mean, when in your use cases because I'm still kinda fresh on the whole, like, knowledge of each model when it comes to knowledge based stuff. Do the mini and nano model models Usually, operate pretty well, like or if we were to use, like, a Haiku or something from Anthropic, are those pretty smooth? Or do they usually take a little bit of time? To respond? They're they're pretty successful. I actually just finished with another account that I was working with, and I think we ended up building their use case was so large. We built maybe 10 different prompts for one exact flow, and the flow takes about I think it was maybe 80 steps. Took about one to two minutes to complete. But since it's an automation, it's happening in the background, so no one actually knows what's going on. And we haven't seen any failures with how those models are working. For that specific use case. So they're pretty successful. I think it really depends on what you're asking for it to do, and that's what we're here to help with. We're you know, us, the TAMs, are pretty knowledge like, have a lot of knowledge on how to work best with AutomateFlow. And sometimes, like, you're you might be working with the AI prompts and giving them a lot of information. And we'll take a look at that and kind of give our recommendations on maybe this should be you know, split up into different steps, to kind of help get the best out of the platform. And does it by chance there's another thing that or another program that we're looking at where it can based off of the question that's being asked, it can use a specific model? Is it smart enough to swap models based off of what the task or it always gonna be one specific model? For this, it's gonna be one specific model. For this specific, like, built in AI step. Within the Zaps. But with our agents tool, it actually goes between a few different models to get the best results. Yeah."

          "text": "Gotcha. Yep. Yeah. This is, like, a very simplistic skeleton of just a few things that you can do within AutomateFlow. But we have a lot of like, flexibility. You can have different branches, different conditional logics, based on the different routes you wanna take. And since you're kind of setting up an automation, kinda only touching it once a few times while you're testing. But once it's actually published and ready to go, you're not gonna be in there much, like, altering it. So And I see you guys so whimsical is pretty similar to DocSpace in a sense. With your DocSpace tool, are you able to kinda do that filtering thing like we asked for? Like, it only goes to specific I don't know how what DocSpace's boarding is, but, like, only goes to specific note notebooks or specific groups or something or is DocSpace just, like, you know, everything at one time? Yeah. So let's look at DocSpace. It really depends on the app itself. And what the the actions that are set up for the app. So every app's have its own separate actions. For example, here, we have everything for DocSpace. You can add content to a specific page. Can create a page, retrieve a page. So let's say we were retrieving a page We would set up our account. We'll use this one. And then on the next screen here is where you're gonna configure it. So this is where you would actually do all of that filtering. What we do here is we ask for specific data. We can either get this from previous steps. So, for example, maybe we're pulling in, the page ID from a database and we're having that be dynamic based on, you know, what was triggered, who was chatting, or we could have it be static. We know it want it we want it to get this specific page every single time this automation is run. So we have a lot of flexibility here for the filtering. It really just depends on what's the use case and the needs. Okay. And Paul and John, I'll reach out to our whimsical guy to see if we can, one, even get the API token because I guess it's in beta. But, two, one information it provides if we can if it gives, like, a or something because we should be able to technically filter it like a yes or no if it's in this group, then reply with the same. If not, then so I'll reach out to them and see if it's something that we can get And then as we're kind of talking about this flow, and I guess it's me trying to understand. When we're talking about an agent, is when we set up an agent, do you set up multiple agents Is it one agent? What's kind of the recommendation for that? So we have one for one team? Or a different one for a separate team when this workflow comes in? Is it all just kind of filtered from what's pulled from Whimsical and then depending on the agent or who has the question, how does that all work? Yeah. So it really depends on how we wanna set this up or how y'all wanna set it You can have it be as free as you'd like, or if you'd want whenever someone asks a question within Teams, you could always respond with an initial you know, template. So for example, our help desk kind of does this here. If I ever have an issue and I need to go to our IT team, if I throw in whatever message I want in our TeamChat team, I always get the same response back. Of we need x, y, and z data points from you. So you can always have, like, a a generic message that's always sent as the first touch point asking for those specific pieces, and then that can be used, to do the filtering within the agent. So now that we got those those pieces of information, take those pieces of data very similar to this, put it into, like, this kind of filtering option, dynamically, and then do the the rest of the automation."

So it's just we're just trying to clarify and also create some boundaries as well. To an extent, some of our file folders and we use SharePoint quite regularly. Would be linked to SharePoint. Well, we don't want people pulling from our finance drive. So there's there's definitely some kind of structure in there that that we just need to FlowBuilder sure is in and capable and and more confident and comfortable with that."

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Mhmm. Yeah. So let me show you SharePoint. It might be a little difficult since I don't have a specific account that I can actually connect to. We'll see if we have one that's already shared. And then is it based on the person that asked the question? So you basically ask you how to roll to each person? So Alex mentioned, there's a few different ways that you can go about doing this. It really depends on, like, what we decide as the, like, the use case. How we're gonna wanna do this. When you're setting up the actual Zap itself, though, when you're choosing an action, you're choosing one account, that you wanna connect to. So if you did want this one Zap to be used by everyone, I would recommend, like, setting this up for a specific like, admin who has access to all of the files that you wanna share with folks. So if not, then you would need to have a separate Zap for each team. So, like, if you only want the Zap to only have access to, like, the HR teams, you would set up their account here. But on the next step, I'll actually show you what we can do kind of as, like, an an option. So let's So we can search. We can find a file. Let's see if we can continue with this one. In in the configure, we can choose, like, the site, the folder itself specifically. And then we can choose, like, the name. Peer is kind of where we were gonna do that dynamic field as well. So if we wanted to, we can have, like, a checkpoint as a previous step of collecting that person's information. And then here, we would have, like, a that dynamic input of only get the folder because they were in a specific like, in a specific team. One great way to do that is with, like, a filter. So we could say, like, in this filter, only continue on and keep going through this step. If they're part of this specific team. We can also do something like paths where it's like, if we have you know, the set number of teams, HR, accounting, finance, whatnot, we can have it go down a specific route depending on what team that they're on. But the action itself would be connected to, like, an overall global source of information. It just won't keep going unless that checkpoint is actually passed. Any questions there? I think, Paul, our our better route with that is probably more to have different, like, agents in in teams that are based on the permissions of, like, those people, and then they're given a dataset because, like, I I don't know how much we're gonna be be able to limit. And then can continue or question now kinda looking at this page that you're currently on, and excuse my I don't know the lingo exactly that you guys use, but each of these steps is considered a like, commit. Because I know that, like, when you buy from you guys, it's like a 100,000 steps or or zaps or whatever it's called. Is this zap that we have created, is this considered one step, or would this be considered eight tokens each time that it's running this Zap? So it's every step Go ahead, Alex."

So, like, for example, that trigger could this, like, first step could happen, the trigger, but it doesn't actually continue because you had some kind of check checkpoint here. None of those subsequent steps are gonna count as tasks. At all because they didn't they didn't actually go through. Could gotcha. Oh, sorry. Could we potentially just just another question. Potentially, add different agents for different folders of SharePoint? So, like, for example, like, HR folder, a different agent for that. Billing operations, different agent for that. That way, just goes through one step each time. Just to kinda organize that, and that would help with the permission stuff too. Right? So that's kind of my thought process. Okay. Yep. That would be, like, that path option that I was kind of highlighting here. Yeah. And then, I guess, when we're talking about kind of the price point, obviously, the number of that happen. If someone asks a question and it pulls from Whimsical, pulls it to the level, the agent responds with whatever that information is. Someone asked a clarifying question. Does it go back from the agent all the way back to the beginning, or does it just go agent and back? Like, is that another two tasks, three tasks, four tasks? How do how do we think about, like, total number of tokens to that extent? Yeah. So that's that's the really difficult part. That would actually probably be a completely different Zap itself. So this is probably gonna be the setup for getting all of the information that you want, and maybe we'll only flow if you actually need some some files returned. If someone had, like, a just a separate question, they might go through a different SAP and a different step or solution, or we could even FlowBuilder it be branch of this Zap where it says, like, hey. I received an additional message. Do I need to get another file? Go down this path. If not, like, you know, maybe use a separate AI tool to to get a response, and then it would kind of go back and loop through every single time. So it really depends on, like, route they're gonna take. Are they actually getting more information, or do we just have to keep going back and forth through dialogue? Yeah. And I I imagine It's really hard to I was gonna say, it's just it's just really hard to calculate. Because you don't know how long the conversations are actually gonna And and I was gonna say, Paul, I'd imagine if it's crawling the document, it's like, if you ask clarifying question on that specific document, I'd imagine it didn't it doesn't have anywhere else to go because it's pulling from that straight document. It's not like it's gonna be like, oh, let me clarify this for you and try to find some similar document. And try to FlowBuilder it so I I that's kind of, like, what I'm thinking. From from this kind of scenario. Right? So Yeah. I'm just I'm trying to think of all the outside cases that returns a wrong document. Yes. It's Yeah. Question again, and then it has to go find another document after that. Perfect segue. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Gonna say we also just have, like, fallback options within our pad as well. So for example, I just worked on another use case where we set up something that we call request for approval or human in the loop, which allows you to not allow the Zap to kind of keep going over and over again. Because we wanted to have an escalation point. So maybe someone just, like, isn't getting anywhere. For example, like, that help desk option I shared about our our IT team, there is an option there that says, like, do I wanna continue working with this AI chat, or do I wanna escalate and get an agent like, actual team member looking at this? Yeah. So there's also those, like, different points, of contact that you can get through to actually stop the flow. Yeah. Thank you for that because my I was gonna segue into one of the items in the the steps where the usage logging just so that I can we can kind of vet and FlowBuilder sure that you know, the same questions and just kind of the the constant, like, know, like, missed use of the the the tasks, should you say, can be kind of seen as more of a, a yeah. Yeah. I just wanna see if there's a usage log what kind of questions are being asked, That way we can see, like, oh, this one person asked a 175 different questions, but it's the same answer over and over and over again. Right? So so that we can kinda stop that from from a, you know, like a accountability standpoint kinda thing. So I just wanted to see if there's anything like that. Yeah. So we don't have, like, a would say, like, an admin center that's gonna do, like, an analysis of exactly what happens during those conversations. But I know Alex brought up a really good example, last time where you can kind of do something very similar to the chat here. Have a different automation flow for, like, a separate agent that's kind of doing that in the background. So with every single zap zap that's triggered or agent that's triggered, we could have, like, an integration maybe with AutomateFlow tables where it logs all of the the data that happened within the chat, how many messages were sent back and forth, what was the outcome of it, was it escalated or not, and then we could have it run on a schedule. Maybe every week, every month, you get, like, a a report that is analyzed through AI, through a separate agent, and lets you know how that's working. This admin center is really good for just understanding how how many, like, Zaps are running. So what your tasks usage is overall, what how, like, successful are your apps, Zaps that are running, and, like, what has aired out. We have, like, an audit log as well where you can see the activity of how often the automations have been running. But you won't get, like, that granular information of, like, who chatted here, who did that. Just because AutomateFlow is so flexible. Everyone's kinda doing something different with their automations. So this test kinda giving you, like, a high level overview. Of what's happening. Thank you."

Thing that I I tried to catch before we went away from the page, but looking at the SharePoint AutomateFlow step, Is that when when you have it pull that document, is it reading over it considered one, or then then do you need an a second step for it to read the document over to provide the information out of it? I have to double check. I can afterwards. I have to do some testing, but it I think it return all of that information to you, like, actual file. But if you wanted to, like, analyze it, that's probably gonna be an additional step. Like, if wanna to provide a summary or something like that. But if you wanted to just get the raw file itself and pass it on to another step, you wouldn't need any additional information. Got it. Okay. With tools like CRMPlatform and monday.com that we also use do you guys have a read write option? Mhmm. Yep. And I do wanna actually highlight our app permissions. So like I mentioned, admin center is kind of one of those enterprise features where you have, that dashboard we initially looked at, analytics and audit logs. But we also have a lot of governance fee governance features, which are really awesome. We have the two two kind of options here. We have restricted apps and allowed apps. So restricted apps means that no one is gonna be able to use those apps. You don't like, for example, you might have your s three bucket. You want your like, no one to be touching this, no one to be able to, you know, use that even if they have a login. You just don't want your team actually having any automations there for security reasons. If we were to go to allowed apps, this is kind of the opposite. So it's saying which apps are allowed to be used by your team members, and it doesn't have to be all or nothing. So, for example, I'm gonna go into that s three exam everyone is only allowed everyone who has a a login to AutomateFlow, can only do these specific things. So they're allowed to get information but they're not allowed to write So I can restrict it so that they can read, but they can't write. But I am not doing this just for everyone. I also have, like, a another level here where I want a specific team to have restrictions that are allowed to write and read because they're on the solutions architect team. So this is the only exception to that everyone rule. And you build that team directly in here. So basically, you have a team and then you just assign people to it. We have our user management, so you can build a bunch of different teams so that you can control those app permissions. Cool. Know we have two minutes left, I believe. Wow."

I guess question I would ask is based off of what you've seen here, do you feel confident in, like, the technical capability? Obviously, there's a lot of work to do to, like, build it. But are there are there questions that you would need to answer to feel saying, yes, at least AutomateFlow can do the things that we need. Still."

It'd be a limitation from the whimsical side is if they can break down specific documents because Whimsical's kinda similar to SharePoint in a sense where specific folders have specific permissions because they might have information that's, you know, a little more sketchy for other people to view. So I'd have to see if that"

SharePoint from a perspective too, I guess that's more of one that I feel slightly more comfortable on, but I would need to, like, see a test of it to see if what data is actually being outputted. Actually fits with it. So I'd probably don't exactly have a a straight answer until I find out with with whimsical if it seems like it could. I mean, it seems like it can do a bunch of things and we've kind of found with all these different programs that we're looking at that Google environments or usually have a little more access than the Microsoft environments do. So I guess we would just kinda need to see how it works if we were to plug in our stuff with it. Yeah. Actually, I just took a quick"

And just a housekeeping question. Like, when connecting into the API of women's does it need a license? Does AutomateFlow need a Whimsical license to be able to pull that information in to as its own kind of user? We would need some kind of authentication if that API requires So y'all would need to to have that input, and we wouldn't share that with anyone. It would just be solely for your account and whoever actually has access to that specific Zap. So it doesn't need like, you could even build it privately so that only you, John, have access to that workflow. And else on your team can actually get those credentials because they don't have access to edit that. Workflow. Sweet."

And then I guess I also heard it's it's like you would you wanna actually see something around SharePoint. Like, it it's like it sounds like you, like, theoretically agree it works, but you would need to, like, see it like, an actual flow before you feel fully confident there. Is that fair?"

I'm just my my main thing and I I don't know if this is even a a possibility and even in the AI world that we're we're living in at the moment, but our our kind of goal that we're looking for is less for it to be like, hey. I found this file. Here you go. And then you go read the file. We're looking more for it to, like, have a knowledge source that it can now provide that information to you. In a summarized result. So I would need to kinda just see. I know that everything can be tailored a million different ways. So, like, you know, we we would have to require some testing. But, yeah, I guess that's kinda what I would wanna more just see because if it's just providing a link to a SharePoint, then I'd rather people just use a search bar instead of doing that. But if we can find a way where it can, like, summarize the data that it's actually reading, then I I think that's something that we'd be looking more to do."

Yeah. We definitely wanna see some use cases, obviously. It sounds great in theory. But theory is only one thing. We we do wanna see that it can grab something I can ask it a question from CRMPlatform. It'll grab either a contract or a a number or a person or information from that. Same thing with Monday. If I can link it back to a Monday board, all of our tasks oriented, kind of focuses through that system. It's just thinking about all of our diff different systems and not having to go find it necessarily. And then to Ethan's point, it doesn't just tell me to go back to this board or tell me to go to this document. It actually gives me what I'm asking for.

I would encourage you just to, like, play around with those because, honestly, that is, like, one of the easiest use cases that we have people try.

(135 hrs/month, $73K/year)\n2. **Copilot intel** - What happened with their evaluation? Still in play?\n3. **Map the decision** - Who else needs to be involved? What's the process?\n4. **Expand the vision** - Move from \"Whimsical chatbot\" to ambient context layer\n5. **Start the trial** - Get him building something in the first 48 hours\n\n---\n\n## Discovery Framework\n\n### Standard MEDDPICC Questions\n\n**Metrics:**\n- \"When we talked in December, you mentioned constant interruptions from your 60-person team. Have you been able to quantify that? How many hours per week do you think get lost to Q&A?\"\n- \"What would success look like 6 months from now?\"\n\n**Economic Buyer:**\n- \"If this proves valuable, who would need to approve budget for a broader rollout?\"\n- \"Is this coming out of your team's budget or would it need IT/finance sign-off?\"\n\n**Decision Process:**\n- \"Walk me through what happens between 'this is working' and 'we're buying this.' Who's involved?\"\n- \"Is there a security or IT review that needs to happen?\"\n\n**Competition:**\n- \"You mentioned you were meeting with IT about Copilot the day we talked. How did that go? Is that still being evaluated?\"\n- \"What else is on the table - are you looking at any other tools?\"\n\n**Champion:**\n- \"Are you the one driving this internally, or is there someone else who's championing AI tools?\"\n- \"Who else on your team is excited about solving this problem?\"\n\n---\n\n### Ambient AI Thesis Discovery\n\n**Weave these in naturally - don't rapid-fire. Use 2-3 that fit the conversation flow.**\n\n**Context Flow:**\n- \"When a new ops team member joins, how do they get up to speed on decisions that were already made? Like if they're dropped into a project mid-stream?\"\n- \"You mentioned Whimsical for documentation - where else does important context live? Teams threads? Email? Meeting notes?\"\n- \"How does feedback from Zendesk tickets FlowBuilder it back to the people maintaining documentation?\"\n\n**Pain Validation:**\n- \"Beyond the interruptions for questions, what else breaks down because of information silos?\"\n- \"How often do meetings happen just because someone didn't have context they could have gotten async?\"\n- \"When something goes wrong with a customer - an escalation or a missed issue - how often is it because a signal got lost somewhere?\"\n\n**Vision Alignment (use if he's engaged):**\n- \"Here's what I'm curious about: if every employee on your ops team had an AI assistant that knew everything happening across Whimsical, Teams, Zendesk, Monday - not just docs, but conversations, tickets, project updates - what would that unlock?\"\n- \"What would it mean if you could ask 'what did we decide about X last quarter' and actually get an answer?\"\n\n---\n\n## Positioning Notes\n\n### If Copilot is still in play:\n\n\"Copilot is great for M365 - Teams, Outlook, SharePoint. The question is: what about Monday.com? Zendesk? Whimsical? CRMPlatform?\n\nMost teams have a mix of Microsoft and everything else. Copilot optimizes for Microsoft. AutomateFlow orchestrates across everything. They're actually complementary - Copilot for your O365 power users, AutomateFlow for connecting the full stack.\"\n\n### If he's thinking too narrow (just chatbot):\n\n\"The chatbot is a great starting point - it solves the immediate pain. But here's what I've seen work even better: once you have that working, the next question is 'what else does my team need context on?'\n\nTeams threads where decisions get made. Zendesk tickets that reveal documentation gaps. Meeting notes with action items. The chatbot is step one. The real value is when all that context flows together.\"\n\n### On Whimsical integration gap:\n\n\"Whimsical doesn't have a native integration today, so we have a couple paths:\n1. Export key docs to Google Docs or DocSpace - both integrate directly with AutomateFlow's chatbot\n2. Use Whimsical's API with a custom action if you want real-time sync\n3. Start with the docs you export most frequently - test the pattern before over-engineering\n\nWhat matters more to you: having everything auto-sync, or getting something working fast?\"\n\n---\n\n## Trial Quick Win\n\n**Recommended first build:** Teams Q&A bot connected to a Google Doc export of their top 10 most-referenced Whimsical pages.\n\n**Why:**\n- Solves the interruption pain immediately\n- Teams is where the questions happen - meet them where they are\n- Google Docs export is fast (no API needed)\n- Proves the pattern before tackling full Whimsical integration\n\n**Talk track:**\n\"Let's get you a win this week. What are the 10 pages your team asks about most? Let's export those to Google Docs, connect them to a AutomateFlow chatbot, and wire it into Teams. Your team can start asking questions in Teams and get answers immediately. That's your test - does it reduce interruptions?\"\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags to Watch For\n\n- \"IT wants us to use Copilot for everything\" → May be a dead deal, or need to find IT champion\n- \"I don't really have budget authority\" → Need to find economic buyer fast\n- \"We're not in a hurry\" → No urgency = deals die. Probe for what would create urgency\n- \"Let me think about it and get back to you\" → Push for specifics. What's he thinking about? When?\n\n---\n\n## Close the Call\n\n- Confirm next steps: What's he building? By when?\n- If trial: \"Can we sync in 48 hours once you've had a chance to build something? I want to FlowBuilder sure you're not stuck.\"\n- If more discovery needed: \"Who else should I be talking to? Can we get them on the next call?\"\n- Get the calendar invite sent before hanging up\n",

Good to get the full picture of what you're solving for and loop in the broader team.\n\nNext Step: Technical Validation Call — February 9th\n\nI'll bring a Solutions Architect to walk through the technical specifics. Our goal for that call is to validate these five things:\n\nWhimsical integration — Can we build a custom action using their beta API (returns HTML) to FlowBuilder your docs searchable?\n\nSharePoint as a knowledge source — Indexing your files without storing them on our side\n\nMonday.com read/write — Agents that can both pull info and update tasks\n\nPermission controls — Different agents for different teams, approval flows before destructive actions\n\nUsage logging — Visibility into what questions are being asked, flagging duplicates, measuring ROI\n\nIf we can demonstrate all five, we're in good shape. If any are blockers, we'll know early.\n\nYour Existing AutomateFlow Usage\n\nDug into your account after the call — I hadn't connected the dots because it's under the Sequr domain (user@user). Makes sense now that I know LifeGen Labs acquired Sequr back in 2020.\n\nYou're running 10-14K tasks/month on technical alerting workflows. That existing usage is helpful context — means we're talking about expanding what's already working, not starting from scratch.\n\nFor Ethan — Security Documentation\n\nA few resources to review ahead of the 9th:\n\nSecurity & Compliance Overview: AutomateFlow.com/security-compliance\n\nTrust Center (SOC 2, certifications, policies): trust.AutomateFlow.com\n\nIf there are specific security requirements or questionnaires you need us to complete, send them over and I'll get them queued up.\n\nROI Estimate\n\nHere's the value estimate I shared on the call: AutomateFlow-roi-calculator.vercel.app/c/hc0l2e\n\nThe numbers are placeholder estimates — we'll refine them once you have a better sense of actual task volumes.
