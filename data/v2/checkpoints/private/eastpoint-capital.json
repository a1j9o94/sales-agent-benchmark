He's actually going to do a presentation. On what AutomateFlow can produce. So I'm just taking this time to give you an overview of what AutomateFlow. What it can provide. And then also give an understanding of what our next steps are internally. So Alex going to come on and give us a demonstration of what AutomateFlow is and how we're going to integrate it. This is Alex, by the way. Sorry you can't see everybody, Alex.  \nMe: No worries.  \nThem: So I wish. Can I plug into. Hold on. Maybe I just need to change my audio. But that's just the overview of kind of what I wanted this meeting to be about. Because one of the things is beyond just pandadot. I just want to get us there. Like, I want to optimize it to where you don't have to keep hiring new people the more clients you get on, so. This is that first step into saying, what other things can we do in the office? What else can we pander doc of sort that we can just pass it on and we can just create an automation that we can create some type of internal process to where you can plug and play. If something happens, somebody gets moved to a different department, you can put another GTE in or whatever that process looks like. I just want to give everyone the opportunity to say, hey, this is the overview of what's possible. And then Alex and I was going to we're going to schedule time with each one of the managers to sit and have a one on one to say, what are those? Pain points. How can we help alleviate these pain points? And what does that look like? And I think they James get so much of a return. On it not only from a time perspective, but also on a stress level of now the employees with different areas, your team actually has an opportunity. To do the work and not just be so bogged down in the process of doing the work. That makes sense. Sound good to everybody. All right, Perfect. So Alex it around. I don't know if you do. Take my. I'm just going to keep it here.  \nMe: The only thing. Can people see your screen? Is it like sharing? Okay.  \nThem: On a large screen. I just wish it could be louder. I don't know if we have to. Should we dial in or.  \nMe: That might help if you dial in on the zoom. People can hear me.  \nThem: Okay? All. Right. Let me get. The phone number. No, it's on my laptop. Let me see. Maybe if I just transfer the audio from here to there.  \nMe: Testing. Am I on the big screen?  \nThem: You're on the screen. There's just not.  \nMe: From the big screen, audio wise.  \nThem: I don't even see this. Okay, you're good to go.  \nMe: I just want to first thank everyone for taking the time today. I know you guys have a lot of stuff going on. Charles has given me just a little bit of taste of how busy you guys are. So even spending 30 woods with me to walk through this, I do appreciate it. Before we jump in, I just want to introduce myself real quick. My name is Alex. I'm an account executive at AutomateFlow. I've spent a lot of years working with companies of lots of sizes, helping them do transformations around it, helping them FlowBuilder more use of AI. And I joined AutomateFlow about four or five months ago, where we can actually help more companies like yours drive and have these initiatives. But that's about me. What I think is more important is where are you guys today? So from the conversations we've had so far, I've kind of heard three things that are important. One, this e filing mandate that came out this year is sort of like a burning platform that you guys have to do something about, which is sort of what was the impetus to even begin this conversation. 2. You've started some work, particularly around the PandaDoc process, but because it's like one piece of your process and any software takes time to get up and running, it's actually at least so far created more work for the team, or maybe not more work, but hasn't given you the time savings yet. That you're hoping to get from in the interim. And then the last thing is, I did not have this context before having the conversation with Charles, but you guys actually have quite a long legacy of what you've built, and it's important that we're not anything that we do doesn't undermine. The reputation and rapport that you guys have in the community, in the sort of Louisiana debt collection business. I James pause there because I think really everything else is dependent on these three things sort of being the right set of things that are important to you guys as a company. Would love any reactions from the room. Is this right? Are these completely off?  \nThem: Everybody see those? Okay? Pretty good consensus. It's hard to read it from over. That's what I was wondering. Hold on.  \nMe: Sorry. A little hard. Hard to read.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Wait, Let me see. Let me switch to, like, a full screen.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: See if that makes that easier. No, not that. Which.  \nThem: Perfect. There we go. Should be able to knock you out of the screen, too, but I don't see it. Okay?  \nMe: Okay, do you guys see the big, like, the full screen of it?  \nThem: Is that better still? You could have read it four times. By that, okay? Okay, so you filing changed everything. The January mandate didn't just add a requirement. It revealed every manual process in your operation. You're adapting. We want to help you do it once. The right way. Your team feels the lift. Panda Doc cls spreadsheet signatures. Staff or stitching systems together by hand. Every manual step is a risk and a cost. Protecting what you've built. Louisiana's largest collection firm. They can give their get there by accident. Automation isn't about replacing people. It's about letting your team focus on what drives value. We're. Good.  \nMe: Okay? Okay, cool. I think. And we can iterate on these over time, but I just want to FlowBuilder sure that these are the right set of metrics that we're like, in write set of goals that we're driving forward as a business. And just to give two seconds of color, I think Charles might have given a little bit of this context before we jumped on, but we have spent a little bit of time already mapping out what your business cases are, and there's sort of one piece of this puzzle that we've actually started to build together, and hopefully the goal today is to get the broader team introduced in, like Charles mentioned, if by the end of this, we could start to have scheduled meetings with some of the other department leads around what are the key things in your areas that you care about? So I guess, first and foremost, just what actually is AutomateFlow? AutomateFlow you can think of as the pipes between your systems. So in your guys's case, it's like cls. You have your Panda doc, you have your filing systems. AutomateFlow allows you to connect things between those automatically. One very like the example I've built with Charles already in the CLS view. It's like, hey, when we send an update from the cls, trigger this Panda Doc Doc document to be created, and then we'll have another one that we'll create is say, hey, when this PandaDoc document is created, go trigger some validation and then send this to the filing. And there are human in the loop steps required. This is designed to be. There's no code. It's not meant to be something where you, like, need to hire a bunch of developers to go do this for you, either through a combination of, like, working with us as partners or even if you just have, like, one off things that you want to do or automate in your day to day. It's designed so that anyone can pick up and use it in a really simple way. I James quickly show just kind of like, what is the platform? Look like to help bring this a life a little bit more beyond just. Oh, we're like connection between systems. So if you were going into AutomateFlow, kind of, this is what you would see. We have the sort of default automations, is what we call a zap, and this is what we'll spend most of our time on. But we also have things like AI agents, where, as an example, I have an agent that runs every day, looks at all of my meetings, creates meeting preps documents for me. We have tables where this is effectively just like a Google Sheets alternative. If you have a database that use instead, if you have Google Sheets, those are all going to be the same thing. Forms, of course, like Google forms, teams, forms, kind of whatever that looks like. And then chatbots, that is like we have, for example, internal. Our legal team has a chatbot that runs before I close any deals and I can talk to, to ask it questions. RHR team has a chat bot that exists where they have some basic information around benefits that I can ask for. But the key, sort of like central most important thing is often zaps. If we were to take as one of the examples, what I've already sort of worked through with Charles is, let's see, I have a CLS system. With a few specific fields for our customers. Or clients, and I want to create a webhook. To get those fields. Then start. A panda document. And so what this James then do is it James go pull in information about all of the different applications that AutomateFlow has. It James sort of architect this basic structure, and then it James actually pull up the details. Of what this is and build it for you. While this is. Pulling together. Sometimes just takes moment. There we go. So now we've handed to this off, it's going to actually go try to start to build these, pull all the relevant information. Pull the relevant keys into here. And by keys, I mean your logins to your CLS, your logins to PandaDoc, so it can actually connect those systems without you having to do any kind of special weird logins, or even have to learn about API keys or anything like that. I James. I'll pause there because this is sort of like the core of what AutomateFlow is. We can talk a bit. We're going to talk more about how what specific automations we're thinking of flying to across different parts of your business, but want to see if any people have questions around. What is. What is AutomateFlow? How do these, like, flows work? How did we. How did I sort of get into the system? Anything that was confusing about what I've walked through so far.  \nThem: No, I think the biggest thing is just showing them how to impact their area.  \nMe: Yeah, okay. And this again, this is a sort of like where this fits. Overall, I think what maybe the most helpful do we have Kurt on the call with us. Actually, one of my colleagues is going to join in just a moment from the law firm to talk a bit about. Sorry, our legal counsel. To talk a bit about what specifically? He's seen work for other law firms and in his role. But what I'll quickly jump to is Charles had sent over to me a bit about what are kind of like each of your departments, and based off of, hey, what are some pain points that we heard? And here's like one or two potential automation opportunities for your departments. And specifically so I'll read through these and then would love to get people's just thoughts reactions to these. So on the client services side, what my understanding of your team's focus placements, media gatherings, demand letters, reg F compliance, and there's lots of validation, like manual validation that you're doing for calculators. So I think the key automation for you guys would be around auto validation, doing some of this calculation for you to help you FlowBuilder faster decisions and not have to do as much manual work in pulling the LIM team. This is around like the suits judgments, garnishments that you're doing. The manual queue reports is what we heard of. As, like, the key, one of the key pain points around here. And the queue automation would allow us to FlowBuilder sure nothing sort of gets lost in the track, lost in the cracks. And status tracking James help you be proactive so that you're not even waiting until after something has gone or after something's been. Delayed to actually react to it. Of course, on the Alex side, actually, it seems like the physical printing, scanning, signing back in, any kind of digital review workflows that we can do seems like would be helpful here. This is, I think, would actually be sort of a natural extension of the PandaDoc work that you guys have already started doing, but it's more about how can we expand that to other pieces of the flow that you guys are working on. And then, of course, the actual document team, where you guys, if I understand correctly, are doing a lot of manual sorting by queue numbers, doing physical delivery. Are there ways that we can help? You guys do more digital routing, help you enable some of these other teams versus just having to do busy work that you might be doing today. And then around accounting. This one I think is a bit more straightforward. Just how are you actually doing data extraction? How are you managing your processes on a week to week, day to day? Basis. And then last but not least, of course, around it can be orchestrate things sort of centrally so you're not having to manually check a lot of these places. I'll pause here because this is another one where I think I've been talking at you for a bit. These resonate with the group. And actually, I would love if you say, like, actually, these are not issues at all for us or. Yeah, talk to me a bit about your actions to this.  \nThem: What about client services? Don't care. And this is just like maybe one pain point what Kurt is doing. Yeah, well, like for instance, right now, Kurt can spend an hour simply. Documents over. I mean. He has. We all have much better uses of our time. So I know that's something. And this is something about those are things like AutomateFlow can do. You can put that in place, you click a button and it moves it. You tell it where the source file is, you say where you want it to go. You can change the name and convention. You can change, maybe even the way the file gets output. There are many things. That they're asking, why is this backed up? We're working through it, and they constantly are telling us that other places haven't already automated. And we do not. David. Media Movement, getting file documents back to the clients. They've all said other places have all of that automated which. That's what this is. Alex from AutomateFlow. I don't know if you know we have an Alex here.  \nMe: Actually, there was a little bit of confusion there.  \nThem: So they might get confusing, but, yeah, I think a lot of what you'll be doing is within client services to begin with. Alex started. You, Alex AutomateFlow. Alex. I mean, think about it. I guess there's certain things that they come in might be able to do, like a Morgan Documents. And cooling things and so we don't have to collate the PDFs reissue or something. I think that's probably the biggest one. Grab it out of big position, stuff like that.  \nMe: Could you spin on that one? You were saying? I heard that's probably the biggest one, but I don't think I heard the details on that.  \nThem: Go ahead. No, I was going to say for the legal account managers, the lams, I think the biggest pain point for us is that you have it somewhere in there. I think the skip tracing part, because the skip tracing part, we have to pull documents from other areas into a document that we then prepare to go to the court. And a lot of times pulling those documents from other areas is time consuming. So there is a way to, I guess, speed up that process. It would be more efficient and then have people not kind of sit on their hands to be able to do that. They would take the time to do it because it doesn't cost as much time for them to be able to produce a reissue out.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So that turn to.  \nMe: Super helpful. And then I heard someone talk a bit about. You've had clients complain about the level of automated. Could you talk to me a bit about that? Is that something that's come up once? Is it something you hear once a week? Talk to me a bit about that context.  \nThem: Another. Sorry. Well, not better. I think we have the most accounts, but more efficiently. Both Track and Midland have directly said that to us. So it might be they might. We talk to the clients once a month, if not more regularly. But past couple of months during our monthly performance call, they have directly said, why haven't y'all automated this yet?  \nMe: That makes a lot of sense. Okay? And then could you talk to me a bit about. How to frame this. I'm sorry. I genuinely just drew a blank on what I was going to ask. So wasn't that important?  \nThem: It's ok.  \nMe: I was going to say these in terms of these activities. Would. Based off of at least what you've heard so far, do you guys think it would be worthwhile to have follow up conversations around? Hey, let's scope out maybe one or two specific automations in each of these areas and it sounds like client services and the LEMS are the two potentially most important and impactful for you guys as a business, but I do want to FlowBuilder sure we kind of get to show. Okay, here's what AutomateFlow could do across the board, if you're looking at that investment.  \nThem: And I was also wondering, like with accounting, are there any manual processes that y'all are currently doing? Whether it's manual calculations, manual input, transferring of files, You know, I know Nick was doing a lot of. He's doing a check and access, right? Is he back to doing that in access? I know my whole team is going to have some concerns. They want to makeup with changing processes and things before, so they're going to want to FlowBuilder sure that it's fully tested. No, I'm okay with that. And that's our hope, that whatever we input, we're going to run it in tandem and then FlowBuilder sure you get the same output before. There's any flip, any switch that gets flipped. But, I mean, if there are, like, when I sat and watched Nick go through that process, I'm like, there's got to be. Like, I just know that there are other ways. But instead of me trying to get a system that only fixes that one problem, AutomateFlow could fix all of them, and we're only going to one source, and they have a tech team that we can always reach out to for help. So it's not like one source. Like, there's no Dustin Cory or Wes. It's. It's here. It's in place. It's. It's standardized. And we can always have someone to reach out to on the tech team that if there's ever a problem that we can or. An upgrade or something changes or something's there. There's. We have a partner in this situation going forward. So that's what I mean. Like, even in that scenario, even though it might be in house. It's checking against it. Might even be a static access database. But now it can be something more fluid, something you update and add, and you can actually pull. In up to date current information. And your team doesn't have to. They're not the ones that's going in to do it. You know, the automation is actually. It's checking, making sure it's updated and then it's pulling that. What Nick is doing is actually pulling from that updated table that's there. You can just. Worry about reconciling and verifying exactly. And Brooke, go ahead.  \nMe: No, I was going to say we work with a lot of companies who are getting onto AutomateFlow for the first time. What we'll often see is for a month or two, they'll just run their current processes and they'll have the automation sort of like running in parallel. And that allows you to actually do that reconciliation, build confidence over time. And so you're like, okay, we're a month in. We haven't had any errors, or the errors we did have, we were able to fix. So we made adjustments to the system that we need to. Now we feel confident to go actually FlowBuilder this change because. And I don't know who said it, but you don't want to put something in your accounting systems and then find out after the fact that there was a mistake, right? That's not a world that anyone wants to live in.  \nThem: There are other. Other law firms like ours. I get who can. Alex. Yes, sir.  \nMe: Yes. Sir.  \nThem: Who are the all the law firms that deal do what we do, who are using you now, who we may be able to use as a resource to figure out how did you fix this? How did you fix that? More focus in on the specifics of what the problem really is. Is that something? Bear with us.  \nMe: I absolutely can actually apologize. Oh, wait. Kurt is on. We have my colleague, Kurt, who is. He's our internal house counsel, but he's had a lot of these conversations with other law firms. Kurt, could you just speak a bit about what you've seen be successful? For other firms.  \nThem: Yeah. To answer the question specifically, I think we have one law firm that uses us for pretty similar Some of some of the workflows that you guys are talking about are pretty similar to what they do. And there are similar law firm like the work that they do is similar to you guys. I would have to reach out to them. Or one of us would have to reach out to them to ask if we can pass on their. Their information to you to talk to, but they might be open to that. The workflows that I think are, like, super successful for the law firms that I've talked with are all, like, Very like deterministic workflows. Things like the document generation like that is something that we use internally. So we connect our SalesCloud to our ironclad instance and, and populate all of the data through those contracts. From the data from SalesCloud. Same thing for any like NDA requests, any vendor agreement request. All of those documents are populated from templates in Ironclad and we get all the data from one system, add it to Ironclad, and then it's the finished and signed contracts are moved back over to the other system or uploaded to our Google Drive, which is what we use for our kind of repository of contracts. The others are, like client communications, so giving, like, status updates to clients and tracking deadlines. Alongside the clients as well. So sending out messages to clients saying, hey, just letting you know that the lawyer has checked in this document, or the lawyer is file, filed this document with the court, all of that kind of stuff I've seen attorneys do. And they, they kind of love those because they don't have to. Manually do that. And then the other thing. I don't know how much you guys are interested in this, but using AI To. Help with, like the either drafting documents or. Or reviewing documents. Has been super helpful. We so with our enterprise plan, we do not train on any of the data, we don't allow our, the, the model providers to train on any of the data, and we have enterprise level controls over like, how long the data is retained, all of that kind of stuff. And Alex can talk you through that, but we've kind of. Talked through that with a lot of law firms and other in house legal teams, and essentially. All of them that. That. That I've talked to have become comfortable with it. And it's. It's basically like. It depends on your agreements with your. Your clients and things like that, whether you can do it. But the models have gotten so good at extracting data from, from contracts and reviewing contracts and providing, like, red lines and all of that kind of stuff. You could do with AutomateFlow. And those things have been like, That's. That's kind of like the big this saves us hours and hours and hours every single day type workflows. That was a lot to throw at you all at once. But let me go back to the first question. What we do in sperm similar to ours is a very high volume. For an example, I've been told we're the largest file of documents in the state. All right. Well, is the high volume an issue with you? Is one question. But more importantly, if you can tell me which other, you know, firms like ours, they're probably 300, 400 in the country. If I can. I mean, are you doing a lot of those? You have one. Do you have 100? And also, can you tell us who they are so we can find out, you know? How you doing this? How's it going? Is your body and crash system, does it not interface with that? You know, some sort of real life?  \nMe: Yeah. I can. I James take that as an action to, like, actually get you some real data around that and at least get you real data around, like, what our customer base here looks like. And we'll try to get you an actual conversation with one of our customers, assuming they're willing to have that. I'll take that as an action coming out of this.  \nThem: I don't want one of these customers. I want one of your customers that does what we do.  \nMe: Yes. Yeah, yeah. Specifically, like a customer that does what what you guys are doing.  \nThem: I'm sorry. I understand you need to ask, but I've got no problem with that.  \nMe: Absolutely.  \nThem: I don't want to talk to medical supply guy. I want to talk to somebody. That's what we do.  \nMe: Absolutely. Let me take that as an action. I'll try to find some good examples here. And we'll put you in touch with people who do similar work that you can actually point to. Like, how's this work with their system? What broke? What did our partnership look like? Like, all of that kind. All of those kinds of things.  \nThem: And even to FlowBuilder it worse, I don't want to talk to one. I want to talk to three or four of them.  \nMe: I'll get you as many as we can. So this is I. This might be a place where of, like, I don't know how many specifically, like, debt collection firms we have. I know we work with lots of law firms, but, like, I just transparently don't know enough about the work that they're all doing to be able to say they're specifically doing this kind of work. So I don't want to promise, like I can definitely get you that. It sounds like Kurt's aware of at least one that does it exactly the same thing or very similar to what you guys are doing, but I can also play you. And guys, I. I James at least find other law firms to put you in touch with. But I'll do my best to get you a clean examples there and definitely understand what you're. What you're getting at. Like you want to see like what it actually looks like, right? Like, because it's one thing for me to say it right, Me. Our job is to sell you AutomateFlow. So we're going to be like, oh, it's great. Like, it's all perfect. You want to see kind of like what does actually look like in practice?  \nThem: Right. Well. And in the same man. Yeah. I want to talk to some of them, but I also want to know how many of them you're doing. If some other Service is doing 100 of them and you're doing two of them, well, I need to know that.  \nMe: Yeah. That's fair.  \nThem: Like. I then ask you intelligently tell me how you better, you know, help me help you.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's, that's a great point. And actually, what I can do is what we one thing we often do is we put together a basically like a rubric of like, hey, here are the types of things that clients look at when they're comparing automation platforms. And this is what was where I need to maybe go do some homework around. I actually don't know of other like, of other law specific ones or other ones that would have like, more providers in this space, but I don't want to sort of like speak out of turn without having done that actual research here.  \nThem: That's fair. Can we say? I don't care. Don't. I'm not asking you to tell me who your competitors are. I want you to tell people you're working with to do what we do so we figure out. Making the right call.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: 100%. So it sounds like that. That's one key big thing. It's like, hey, let's get you connected with an existing customer who does what you do. You can hear that from them. The other. I guess I want to, like, test the temperature of the group on this. Charles had originally said one of the outcomes here is like, hey, let's do individual conversations with each of the team leads and maybe starting with client services and LIMs to say, what flows should we be building for you guys specifically? Do you feel like that's a good, good use of time. While in parallel, we're getting you some of those, like, customer, customer, whatever we call those.  \nThem: Testimonials. Yeah, testimonials, he said. Yeah.  \nMe: The word I was looking for.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And I'm just testimonials, but actual engagements, because I don't. I'm not just going to give you, like, a paper. Right. I want to, like, actually someone.  \nThem: Yeah. Do y'all feel like that's fair? Client services certainly. And I mean, might even be able to cloud services twice before. Okay. Because, I mean, that is the area most right for it. You're like, I definitely want to get, get put them in touch with the county just because I've seen it. Like, I've sat and watched it. But client services for sure. I don't know if. Doc, team, if y'all have anything that you're doing manually right now that could help. It's not. It's not a must, but. I can't think of anything. Because. We have too much physical. Document moving, and the only thing that I was thinking I didn't know. When you bring things to paper vision, is there a manual process that does that, or is that an automation? Automation that drop like. Well, the scanners for dog team, it goes straight to the correct folder, right? Yeah. Okay? And then pulling from the folder's automation. Those same folders Client services still has to manually put them in. There's an automation. Already. That does put it in paper. Okay? And that's, that's. That's kind of what, you know, we'll definitely discuss in these calls. If there. I couldn't. I knew there were some folder moving and naming of files and that sort of a thing. Most of our clients are pretty good at naming things where we just move it and we're good. Others. There's a folder inside of a folder. And they're not named correctly because the folders go off of the system to be able to pair it to the account number. In paper vision. And so we are having to remain things. This is the type of system that could actually dig into that, you know, drill into that folder structure, grab the file, rename it, and put it where I would imagine. So it's like the folder James be named our account number. Right? Or their account number. And then inside of it, it just says, Contract transaction automatic. Put it on top of that. But. Yeah, yeah, but that's what we're really doing. But I just really, definitely wanted to give an overview and then also gauge, like, what that looks like if we're going in the right direction. I feel like we are, because ultimately, my goal. I want to get as many of you streamline and automate it. Now you have the freedom to think beyond that. What's the next level of streamline? What's the next level of getting your team to that next tier? Because Mr. Egan's built a great legacy of creating something that's so. Lasting, and I just want to see it continue. And if we're at the forefront of this technology gap, Then we'll leave everyone behind and we can take on new clients. As we take on new clients. Now we have the bandwidth to take on those clients because everything's running full. So just swim for a minute. File. And they start sending us back everything electronically. And does this come in the way it helps? Anymore. Yeah, yeah. We just. I don't know. I need to see how it would work, I guess. Yeah, sometimes they don't provide any of the races about what it is. That's kind of. Alex, back to you. I think a lot. And I don't want to speak to the managers because y'all can interact as much as either of you. Build an essay. But I think if you can tell somebody that's in our business that's doing it and get them to tell us how it works and how it doesn't work, or, you know, then we ask more intelligent questions of you. I mean, right now, I mean, I'm kind of glazed over. I mean, I. Kind of get the drip.  \nMe: But it's a lot to take in and and like, for all these kinds of things, there's sort of the devil's in the details, right? It's one thing to be like, oh, yes, you know, if they if the court starts sitting back documents, like, how do we take those in? But it'll really depend on what specifically they send back, how are they coordinated? What do we need to do with that? What information do we have to pull from it? So all those things FlowBuilder a ton of sense. And you'll get a much better, clearer picture of that from talking to another law firm who's done this. Before.  \nThem: Definitely.  \nMe: Okay, awesome. Okay, so then as. As next step, let's Charles, you and I we can coordinate on getting those client services lim meetings on the calendar. And then I James take as the action to find. Well, two things. One, just like, hey, how many of these types of law firms do we have? What in practice are we specifically seeing? Them doing. And then here's maybe one that, like, does exactly what you do and two or three others that do similar things that you could, that are worth talking to, that you could talk to as an existing customers. Those are what I'm thinking of as next steps. Anything else that you guys want to do or. Even just like random questions that you have information I could share and the answer can be no, but when I'm just offer that.  \nThem: I think we're good. I think you've got a flavor a little bit better flavor what we do, and we've got little better flavor of what you do. So I think. That's a good place. A bit of complicated.  \nMe: Well, I appreciate. I appreciate all of you taking the time. Mr. Eastpoint? Both. Both Mr. There's two Mr. Eatons, right?  \nThem: Well, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Kurt. I appreciate you jumping on on such short notice, but we just felt like, you know, having someone that could speak the talk. In addition to Alex, would really help. So we're excited to see what we can come from, what comes from our meetings, and where we're going to go next. So thank you.  \nMe: Have a great day.  \nThem: Thank you. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/327beaac-13ca-49f7-a5b4-3978024c76ac](https://example.com/...

This is that first step into saying, what other things can we do in the office? What else can we pander doc of sort that we can just pass it on and we can just create an automation that we can create some type of internal process to where you can plug and play.

Charles has given me just a little bit of taste of how busy you guys are. So even spending 30 woods with me to walk through this, I do appreciate it. Before we jump in, I just want to introduce myself real quick. My name is Alex. I'm an account executive at AutomateFlow. I've spent a lot of years working with companies of lots of sizes, helping them do transformations around it, helping them FlowBuilder more use of AI. And I joined AutomateFlow about four or five months ago, where we can actually help more companies like yours drive and have these initiatives. But that's about me. What I think is more important is where are you guys today? So from the conversations we've had so far, I've kind of heard three things that are important. One, this e filing mandate that came out this year is sort of like a burning platform that you guys have to do something about, which is sort of what was the impetus to even begin this conversation. 2. You've started some work, particularly around the PandaDoc process, but because it's like one piece of your process and any software takes time to get up and running, it's actually at least so far created more work for the team, or maybe not more work, but hasn't given you the time savings yet. That you're hoping to get from in the interim. And then the last thing is, I did not have this context before having the conversation with Charles, but you guys actually have quite a long legacy of what you've built, and it's important that we're not anything that we do doesn't undermine. The reputation and rapport that you guys have in the community, in the sort of Louisiana debt collection business. I James pause there because I think really everything else is dependent on these three things sort of being the right set of things that are important to you guys as a company. Would love any reactions from the room. Is this right? Are these completely off?"

          "speaker": "them",

        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Okay, do you guys see the big, like, the full screen of it?"
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Is that better still? You could have read it four times. By that, okay? Okay, so you filing changed everything. The January mandate didn't just add a requirement. It revealed every manual process in your operation. You're adapting. We want to help you do it once. The right way. Your team feels the lift. Panda Doc cls spreadsheet signatures. Staff or stitching systems together by hand. Every manual step is a risk and a cost. Protecting what you've built. Louisiana's largest collection firm. They can give their get there by accident. Automation isn't about replacing people. It's about letting your team focus on what drives value. We're. Good."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Okay? Okay, cool. I think. And we can iterate on these over time, but I just want to FlowBuilder sure that these are the right set of metrics that we're like, in write set of goals that we're driving forward as a business. And just to give two seconds of color, I think Charles might have given a little bit of this context before we jumped on, but we have spent a little bit of time already mapping out what your business cases are, and there's sort of one piece of this puzzle that we've actually started to build together, and hopefully the goal today is to get the broader team introduced in, like Charles mentioned, if by the end of this, we could start to have scheduled meetings with some of the other department leads around what are the key things in your areas that you care about? So I guess, first and foremost, just what actually is AutomateFlow? AutomateFlow you can think of as the pipes between your systems. So in your guys's case, it's like cls. You have your Panda doc, you have your filing systems. AutomateFlow allows you to connect things between those automatically. One very like the example I've built with Charles already in the CLS view. It's like, hey, when we send an update from the cls, trigger this Panda Doc Doc document to be created, and then we'll have another one that we'll create is say, hey, when this PandaDoc document is created, go trigger some validation and then send this to the filing. And there are human in the loop steps required. This is designed to be. There's no code. It's not meant to be something where you, like, need to hire a bunch of developers to go do this for you, either through a combination of, like, working with us as partners or even if you just have, like, one off things that you want to do or automate in your day to day. It's designed so that anyone can pick up and use it in a really simple way. I James quickly show just kind of like, what is the platform? Look like to help bring this a life a little bit more beyond just. Oh, we're like connection between systems. So if you were going into AutomateFlow, kind of, this is what you would see. We have the sort of default automations, is what we call a zap, and this is what we'll spend most of our time on. But we also have things like AI agents, where, as an example, I have an agent that runs every day, looks at all of my meetings, creates meeting preps documents for me. We have tables where this is effectively just like a Google Sheets alternative. If you have a database that use instead, if you have Google Sheets, those are all going to be the same thing. Forms, of course, like Google forms, teams, forms, kind of whatever that looks like. And then chatbots, that is like we have, for example, internal. Our legal team has a chatbot that runs before I close any deals and I can talk to, to ask it questions. RHR team has a chat bot that exists where they have some basic information around benefits that I can ask for. But the key, sort of like central most important thing is often zaps. If we were to take as one of the examples, what I've already sort of worked through with Charles is, let's see, I have a CLS system. With a few specific fields for our customers. Or clients, and I want to create a webhook. To get those fields. Then start. A panda document. And so what this James then do is it James go pull in information about all of the different applications that AutomateFlow has. It James sort of architect this basic structure, and then it James actually pull up the details. Of what this is and build it for you. While this is. Pulling together. Sometimes just takes moment. There we go. So now we've handed to this off, it's going to actually go try to start to build these, pull all the relevant information. Pull the relevant keys into here. And by keys, I mean your logins to your CLS, your logins to PandaDoc, so it can actually connect those systems without you having to do any kind of special weird logins, or even have to learn about API keys or anything like that. I James. I'll pause there because this is sort of like the core of what AutomateFlow is. We can talk a bit. We're going to talk more about how what specific automations we're thinking of flying to across different parts of your business, but want to see if any people have questions around. What is. What is AutomateFlow? How do these, like, flows work? How did we. How did I sort of get into the system? Anything that was confusing about what I've walked through so far."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "No, I think the biggest thing is just showing them how to impact their area."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yeah, okay. And this again, this is a sort of like where this fits. Overall, I think what maybe the most helpful do we have Kurt on the call with us. Actually, one of my colleagues is going to join in just a moment from the law firm to talk a bit about. Sorry, our legal counsel. To talk a bit about what specifically? He's seen work for other law firms and in his role. But what I'll quickly jump to is Charles had sent over to me a bit about what are kind of like each of your departments, and based off of, hey, what are some pain points that we heard? And here's like one or two potential automation opportunities for your departments. And specifically so I'll read through these and then would love to get people's just thoughts reactions to these. So on the client services side, what my understanding of your team's focus placements, media gatherings, demand letters, reg F compliance, and there's lots of validation, like manual validation that you're doing for calculators. So I think the key automation for you guys would be around auto validation, doing some of this calculation for you to help you FlowBuilder faster decisions and not have to do as much manual work in pulling the LIM team. This is around like the suits judgments, garnishments that you're doing. The manual queue reports is what we heard of. As, like, the key, one of the key pain points around here. And the queue automation would allow us to FlowBuilder sure nothing sort of gets lost in the track, lost in the cracks. And status tracking James help you be proactive so that you're not even waiting until after something has gone or after something's been. Delayed to actually react to it. Of course, on the Alex side, actually, it seems like the physical printing, scanning, signing back in, any kind of digital review workflows that we can do seems like would be helpful here. This is, I think, would actually be sort of a natural extension of the PandaDoc work that you guys have already started doing, but it's more about how can we expand that to other pieces of the flow that you guys are working on. And then, of course, the actual document team, where you guys, if I understand correctly, are doing a lot of manual sorting by queue numbers, doing physical delivery. Are there ways that we can help? You guys do more digital routing, help you enable some of these other teams versus just having to do busy work that you might be doing today. And then around accounting. This one I think is a bit more straightforward. Just how are you actually doing data extraction? How are you managing your processes on a week to week, day to day? Basis. And then last but not least, of course, around it can be orchestrate things sort of centrally so you're not having to manually check a lot of these places. I'll pause here because this is another one where I think I've been talking at you for a bit. These resonate with the group. And actually, I would love if you say, like, actually, these are not issues at all for us or. Yeah, talk to me a bit about your actions to this."

        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "What about client services? Don't care. And this is just like maybe one pain point what Kurt is doing. Yeah, well, like for instance, right now, Kurt can spend an hour simply. Documents over. I mean. He has. We all have much better uses of our time. So I know that's something. And this is something about those are things like AutomateFlow can do. You can put that in place, you click a button and it moves it. You tell it where the source file is, you say where you want it to go. You can change the name and convention. You can change, maybe even the way the file gets output. There are many things. That they're asking, why is this backed up? We're working through it, and they constantly are telling us that other places haven't already automated. And we do not. David. Media Movement, getting file documents back to the clients. They've all said other places have all of that automated which. That's what this is. Alex from AutomateFlow. I don't know if you know we have an Alex here."

I mean, think about it. I guess there's certain things that they come in might be able to do, like a Morgan Documents. And cooling things and so we don't have to collate the PDFs reissue or something. I think that's probably the biggest one. Grab it out of big position, stuff like that."

          "speaker": "me",

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Go ahead. No, I was going to say for the legal account managers, the lams, I think the biggest pain point for us is that you have it somewhere in there. I think the skip tracing part, because the skip tracing part, we have to pull documents from other areas into a document that we then prepare to go to the court. And a lot of times pulling those documents from other areas is time consuming. So there is a way to, I guess, speed up that process. It would be more efficient and then have people not kind of sit on their hands to be able to do that. They would take the time to do it because it doesn't cost as much time for them to be able to produce a reissue out."

Whether it's manual calculations, manual input, transferring of files, You know, I know Nick was doing a lot of. He's doing a check and access, right? Is he back to doing that in access? I know my whole team is going to have some concerns. They want to makeup with changing processes and things before, so they're going to want to FlowBuilder sure that it's fully tested. No, I'm okay with that. And that's our hope, that whatever we input, we're going to run it in tandem and then FlowBuilder sure you get the same output before. There's any flip, any switch that gets flipped. But, I mean, if there are, like, when I sat and watched Nick go through that process, I'm like, there's got to be. Like, I just know that there are other ways. But instead of me trying to get a system that only fixes that one problem, AutomateFlow could fix all of them, and we're only going to one source, and they have a tech team that we can always reach out to for help. So it's not like one source. Like, there's no Dustin Cory or Wes. It's. It's here. It's in place. It's. It's standardized. And we can always have someone to reach out to on the tech team that if there's ever a problem that we can or. An upgrade or something changes or something's there. There's. We have a partner in this situation going forward. So that's what I mean. Like, even in that scenario, even though it might be in house. It's checking against it. Might even be a static access database. But now it can be something more fluid, something you update and add, and you can actually pull. In up to date current information. And your team doesn't have to. They're not the ones that's going in to do it. You know, the automation is actually. It's checking, making sure it's updated and then it's pulling that.

What we'll often see is for a month or two, they'll just run their current processes and they'll have the automation sort of like running in parallel. And that allows you to actually do that reconciliation, build confidence over time. And so you're like, okay, we're a month in. We haven't had any errors, or the errors we did have, we were able to fix. So we made adjustments to the system that we need to. Now we feel confident to go actually FlowBuilder this change because. And I don't know who said it, but you don't want to put something in your accounting systems and then find out after the fact that there was a mistake, right?

        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. To answer the question specifically, I think we have one law firm that uses us for pretty similar Some of some of the workflows that you guys are talking about are pretty similar to what they do. And there are similar law firm like the work that they do is similar to you guys. I would have to reach out to them. Or one of us would have to reach out to them to ask if we can pass on their. Their information to you to talk to, but they might be open to that. The workflows that I think are, like, super successful for the law firms that I've talked with are all, like, Very like deterministic workflows. Things like the document generation like that is something that we use internally. So we connect our SalesCloud to our ironclad instance and, and populate all of the data through those contracts. From the data from SalesCloud. Same thing for any like NDA requests, any vendor agreement request. All of those documents are populated from templates in Ironclad and we get all the data from one system, add it to Ironclad, and then it's the finished and signed contracts are moved back over to the other system or uploaded to our Google Drive, which is what we use for our kind of repository of contracts. The others are, like client communications, so giving, like, status updates to clients and tracking deadlines. Alongside the clients as well. So sending out messages to clients saying, hey, just letting you know that the lawyer has checked in this document, or the lawyer is file, filed this document with the court, all of that kind of stuff I've seen attorneys do. And they, they kind of love those because they don't have to. Manually do that. And then the other thing. I don't know how much you guys are interested in this, but using AI To. Help with, like the either drafting documents or. Or reviewing documents. Has been super helpful. We so with our enterprise plan, we do not train on any of the data, we don't allow our, the, the model providers to train on any of the data, and we have enterprise level controls over like, how long the data is retained, all of that kind of stuff. And Alex can talk you through that, but we've kind of. Talked through that with a lot of law firms and other in house legal teams, and essentially. All of them that. That. That I've talked to have become comfortable with it. And it's. It's basically like. It depends on your agreements with your. Your clients and things like that, whether you can do it. But the models have gotten so good at extracting data from, from contracts and reviewing contracts and providing, like, red lines and all of that kind of stuff. You could do with AutomateFlow. And those things have been like, That's. That's kind of like the big this saves us hours and hours and hours every single day type workflows. That was a lot to throw at you all at once. But let me go back to the first question. What we do in sperm similar to ours is a very high volume. For an example, I've been told we're the largest file of documents in the state. All right. Well, is the high volume an issue with you? Is one question. But more importantly, if you can tell me which other, you know, firms like ours, they're probably 300, 400 in the country. If I can. I mean, are you doing a lot of those? You have one. Do you have 100? And also, can you tell us who they are so we can find out, you know? How you doing this? How's it going? Is your body and crash system, does it not interface with that? You know, some sort of real life?"

And this is what was where I need to maybe go do some homework around.

Because, I mean, that is the area most right for it. You're like, I definitely want to get, get put them in touch with the county just because I've seen it. Like, I've sat and watched it. But client services for sure. I don't know if. Doc, team, if y'all have anything that you're doing manually right now that could help. It's not. It's not a must, but. I can't think of anything. Because. We have too much physical. Document moving, and the only thing that I was thinking I didn't know. When you bring things to paper vision, is there a manual process that does that, or is that an automation? Automation that drop like. Well, the scanners for dog team, it goes straight to the correct folder, right? Yeah. Okay? And then pulling from the folder's automation. Those same folders Client services still has to manually put them in. There's an automation. Already. That does put it in paper. Okay? And that's, that's. That's kind of what, you know, we'll definitely discuss in these calls. If there. I couldn't. I knew there were some folder moving and naming of files and that sort of a thing. Most of our clients are pretty good at naming things where we just move it and we're good. Others. There's a folder inside of a folder. And they're not named correctly because the folders go off of the system to be able to pair it to the account number. In paper vision. And so we are having to remain things. This is the type of system that could actually dig into that, you know, drill into that folder structure, grab the file, rename it, and put it where I would imagine. So it's like the folder James be named our account number. Right? Or their account number. And then inside of it, it just says, Contract transaction automatic. Put it on top of that. But. Yeah, yeah, but that's what we're really doing. But I just really, definitely wanted to give an overview and then also gauge, like, what that looks like if we're going in the right direction. I feel like we are, because ultimately, my goal. I want to get as many of you streamline and automate it. Now you have the freedom to think beyond that. What's the next level of streamline? What's the next level of getting your team to that next tier? Because Mr. Egan's built a great legacy of creating something that's so. Lasting, and I just want to see it continue. And if we're at the forefront of this technology gap, Then we'll leave everyone behind and we can take on new clients. As we take on new clients. Now we have the bandwidth to take on those clients because everything's running full. So just swim for a minute. File. And they start sending us back everything electronically. And does this come in the way it helps? Anymore. Yeah, yeah. We just. I don't know. I need to see how it would work, I guess. Yeah, sometimes they don't provide any of the races about what it is. That's kind of. Alex, back to you. I think a lot. And I don't want to speak to the managers because y'all can interact as much as either of you. Build an essay. But I think if you can tell somebody that's in our business that's doing it and get them to tell us how it works and how it doesn't work, or, you know, then we ask more intelligent questions of you. I mean, right now, I mean, I'm kind of glazed over. I mean, I. Kind of get the drip."

It's one thing to be like, oh, yes, you know, if they if the court starts sitting back documents, like, how do we take those in? But it'll really depend on what specifically they send back, how are they coordinated? What do we need to do with that? What information do we have to pull from it? So all those things FlowBuilder a ton of sense. And you'll get a much better, clearer picture of that from talking to another law firm who's done this. Before."

And then I James take as the action to find. Well, two things. One, just like, hey, how many of these types of law firms do we have? What in practice are we specifically seeing? Them doing. And then here's maybe one that, like, does exactly what you do and two or three others that do similar things that you could, that are worth talking to, that you could talk to as an existing customers. Those are what I'm thinking of as next steps. Anything else that you guys want to do or.

what \n\nCurrently we're doing at \n\nOur first step of the process is demanding the consumer, if we can't get that demand out, we can't go to legal, we're not even allowed to have that account until we do that first demand, holding up revenue, all that\n\nOnly have ~20 clients those 20 clients place thousands of accounts, they have a file, they are all different systems, it can read a majority of those files, there are a few clients where cls does not read their formatting, someone has to \n\nDocument copies, when we do demand the account, that's a letter that goes to the consumer, all those things that are getting filed and sent to the consumer, we have a scanned copy and they get this\n\nIn paper vision, we have a pretty decent process once it's scanend, it's automatically named and updated, demanding 100s of accounts, suing 100s of accounts per day 500-1000 pieces of media that needs to be sent back to people per day\n\nEverything goes in to paper vision - pulling it back down, we're\n\nWhen we have something uploaded in paper vision, if it's a judgement it's going to have an image code, that's how you can pull multiple account numbers and pull and if someone saves it under the\n\nThe automation can read the file type from the name, and place it where it needs to go, renaming takes a while too, Kurt has a powershell, excel sheet with a macro, that we automte, it's still a let.\n\nThey don't have to upload them to anything they load them to an FTP or a sight, they're working for it reactively because they're having to ask for media\n\nThey do in their CLS, they place a code in the file once we have saved something, we say a judgement was filed, it goes on a list to find a copy, then it's pulled and we also do a code\n\nHow do we get our placements, CLS reads the file all that's good except for they currently has an automtion from FTP then it uploads it to the CLS, something keeps happening where files are being missed and that's big where it's a whole placement, or there files, that we're getting daily, some of them have direct payments, so we need to get\n\nMultiple are coming through a day 3 or 4 week are not getting imported\n\nI would think a whole day missing in one day you get 5 of the files, you get them all at once and one gets missed\n\nThe same goes for the exports, for however we recieve the files, some files have differnt formats, some codes in cls, that's not always happenign, that's supposed to be an automation, some days it pulls but doesnt move adn some day it doesn't move them at all, just whether or not we're recieving or \n\nIt's a text file, account number, code related to that\n\nAt placement here's these 20 brand new accounts and we'll get 400 pieces of media that get dropped for that, a few times a month one client does 700 at once\n\nWhen it comes to imports and exports, I don't want to see it, I just want to know it works before it started breaking, the person who uploaded them imports and exports if it breaks \n\nImport and exports are the most important priority, media movement isn't the highest priority, if we can start stomping out the easist, if we do the easist we can have 5 to 10 done and th\n\nAffidavit, if they currently set up an automation to pull our affidavite, and send it it wouldn't work, it's a full project to clean up our templates, review scripts etc, When we demand an account that's the first letter, right after we send that demand we should be requesting an affidavit for our client, who companies who just want to know if they exports aren't working they don't get our code, there are other clients where we have to add a few pieces of media we have to rename it and send it back up to the client, this is something else clients have said others are automated as soon as you get the demand code, upload and back\n\nIt would be a lot on our side first if we do the easier first, that givess us some time to work on these things\n\nWould be great to have better reporting to separate out this is the date we got this placement, for this client we got 700 at once, how many how many are at suit, a lot of clients have the bar graph, that we use a lot not all clients have that our largest clients doesn't have any interace only the smaller clients have that, bar graphs you're saying you have this many of X placement, right now we're going accout by account\n\nThey have a plaint hardship and dispute section that we need to rework we'd probably would want to start some automation going out, that's another thing going to need more time to work on your side\n\nI've I watched our clients to have these productivty sights SalesCloud, may not work like that, if that's just because they didn't have all the, that's where we save all of our client information\n\n## Meeting Notes\n\n### Media Management Challenges\n\n- Receives tons of media from clients - copies of credit card statements, contracts\n- Before inventory got insane, now tens of thousands of PDF documents that have to be moved per day and take time to load\n- Existing automation in process but sometimes breaks\n  - Automation moves media to folder in system\n  - Secondary automation moves it up to Paper Vision (document storage system)\n- Media primarily used for reference purposes\n\n### Missing Media Tracking Issues\n\n- When receiving new account, get tons of media initially\n- For legal process, can request 1-2 pieces of media per account\n- Once fulfilled by client, comes in big giant batches with new media\n- No way to easily track requested media\n  - Must check one spreadsheet showing rejected pieces\n  - Must verify in account that request was made\n  - Must check second spreadsheet for client fulfillment status\n  - Must manually search Paper Vision to confirm receipt\n- Documents come with different naming conventions but James have account number\n- Old media tracking is “what’s really killing us” - spending about 1 hour per day on manual review\n- First step is demanding the consumer - can’t proceed to legal without this\n  - Not allowed to accept money on account until first demand completed\n  - Holding up revenue - clients track delays (3-4 weeks late)\n  - Other competitors have this automated\n\n### Document Processing Bottlenecks\n\n- When demanding accounts, filing with court, getting judgments - all documents must be sent back to client\n- Demanding hundreds of accounts, suing hundreds per day\n- 500-1000 pieces of media per day need to be sent back to clients manually\n- Current process in Paper Vision:\n  - Everything uploaded automatically with decent naming\n  - Manual bulk pulling back down from Paper Vision\n  - Manual renaming using PowerShell/Excel macros\n  - Manual moving to correct folders, zipping, placing in FTP\n- Image codes help with bulk processing (IJDG for judgment, IPET for petition)\n- Clients specifically asking why process is late - say others have automated this\n\n### Import/Export File Processing Failures\n\n- Multiple files coming through per day\n- 3-4 per week not getting imported properly (missing entirely)\n- Automation pulls file from FTP then uploads to CLS system\n- One day might get 5 files at once, one gets missed randomly\n- Creates distrust - must manually double-check files daily\n  - Extremely time consuming to verify\n  - Files contain coding, must find file numbers among other data\n  - Still missing files because can’t check everything daily\n- Same issues with exports:\n  - Files not always created by CLS\n  - Files created but not moved to FTP properly\n- Text files contain account number, notes, codes, balance adjustments\n- New placements: 20 accounts = 400 pieces of media\n- Large client places 700+ accounts at once = 20,000 pieces of media\n\n### Future Automation Priorities\n\n- Import/export issues are highest priority\n  - Want “out of sight, out of mind” - just notification if breaks\n  - Need running list for audit purposes but no daily review required\n- Media movement second priority\n  - Has workarounds but want to eliminate manual work\n  - Focus on easier wins first to free up time for complex projects\n- Affidavit automation requires significant prep work\n  - Must clean up templates and review scripts first\n  - Right after demand letter, should request affidavit from client\n  - Some clients need produced affidavit with media attachments\n  - Clients say others have this automated\n- Better reporting needs:\n  - Track placement dates and progress by client\n  - One client: 700 placements at once, need visibility on suit progression\n  - Want bar graphs showing status across placements\n  - Currently reviewing account by account (not scalable)\n- SalesCloud exploration\n  - Currently only use as address book for client contacts\n  - Interested in productivity reporting features\n  - May integrate for placement tracking and client management\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Sadie to send screenshots of current spreadsheets and processes\n- Alex and Charles to work with solutions architect on technical implementation\n- Focus first on import/export automation, then media processing\n- Consider NDA for document sharing if needed\n\n---\n\nChat with meeting transcript: [https://example.com/...

How's it going?  \nThem: Hey. Good morning. Good. Good. Sorry. I was accepting agreements. Let me close this. How are you today?  \nMe: Doing pretty good.  \nThem: Good. Nice. All right. Sadie's gonna hop on as well.  \nMe: Sounds good.  \nThem: Thank you again, man. I think that call went really well.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah, I completely agree. On our side where I'm digging into some references, client references, to pull those together, to have to share those with Mr. Eden. I think. I think we have a strong case that we can FlowBuilder.  \nThem: Okay? N. Ice. That's good to hear. It's great to hear, actually. I don't know. It wasn't working on my calendar. I actually had to open it, so I don't know if that might be what's going on with her. Trying to think if there's anything else.  \nMe: Oh, they're like the Zoom link wasn't working for you.  \nThem: In the calendar. You can just tap the join button sometimes. Yeah, that wasn't working, so I actually just had to open it and manually click the link and then it open. While we're waiting, I just want to show you something I was working on and just get your feedback right quick.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Share. So. Yes, sir. So this is. So I was just working on something. Right. So we were. I was just kind of testing it out. I think I might have a meeting with Pandadoc today to see if I can potentially get it from them. Right now, what we're doing is we have.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: Oh, hey. I can show you later. It's not a big deal. Oh, I show you quick. Yeah, not a problem.  \nMe: Okay. Yeah, after. Sadie, how are you doing?  \nThem: We can't hear you.  \nMe: Oh, sorry.  \nThem: Sorry. No, I can barely. Find. Speakers on my. Oh, that's right. Things don't work, so. Wait, I can probably use my microphone. Hold on one second. He's probably. Going to. Can you hear me clearly?  \nMe: Yes, now I can.  \nThem: Dang it. Now I can't hear you. Do they have to be the same? No. Okay. Can you hear me clearly?  \nMe: Yes, I can hear.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Yeah, My speakers don't work. And it's not a computer setting. The speakers themselves are, like, broken. Yes.  \nMe: Like a physical speaker. As long as you can hear me. Do the headphones. I think we're good.  \nThem: You know what? I'm going to call you because now I can barely hear you. But we'll stay here and then I'll add the call. Where do I know where I find that? Phone number. Okay, let me do that. I'm going to call in with the phone. Welcome to zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound.  \nMe: You're muted if. I think, like, on the way. Let's see.  \nThem: Okay. Can you hear us?  \nMe: Oh, yes, I can. Does that work?  \nThem: There we go. Okay, we're on the phone.  \nMe: Great. Okay, great.  \nThem: Thank you.  \nMe: That worked out perfectly. Sorry about the technical difficulties. Zoom sometimes is a little rough to work with. I know Charles is making his way back, back to his death. Just made it. So, Sadie, kind of what I'm honestly hoping to use this time as basically a double click to what we talked about last was that Tuesday a couple days ago, with the thought process. Like, hey, just kind of explain to me what is hard about your process. Like, what would you want to do differently? Like, if you could. If you. And not necessarily saying we can do this, but, like, just sort of, like, I want you to be in the mindset of, like, if you could wave a magic wand and, like, this is how my process would be. Like, this is what it would take for me to do. This is the information we would have available to, like, FlowBuilder better decisions. Just walk me a bit through that and then we can. Then I think the idea is, like, me and Charles go and figure out some of, like, the technical capabilities. Behind that, but that's high level, what we're thinking about.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Anything you wanted to specifically FlowBuilder sure we cover other than that.  \nThem: Okay? No. Big old giant list, but we'll start with just a few today. What I'm thinking we can FlowBuilder work. Certainly hoping. But what we do is we receive tons and tons of what we call media from the client. That is, copies of credit card statements and whatnot, copies of contracts. And the clients James drop that to us. And before an inventory got insane. Oh, it takes a minute a day to drag and drop this media. Now there are tens of thousands of PDF documents that have to be moved per day. That takes time to load and we're having to unzip it, then move it, those kinds of things. There is already an automation in process, but then sometimes it breaks. So I don't know if that's something we would then want to update as well, but there is already an automation in process where we move our media to is a folder in our system. Off the computer, and an automation moves that up to. Our. What is paper Vision? A software or website? That's where we store everything that everyone can review it and see it. So that's already happening. But like I said, sometimes that breaks. So that might be something that needs to be updated.  \nMe: Yeah. Could you talk to me? So these documents, they go into paper vision. Like, then is your legal team doing stuff with them? Do they have to, like, track statuses against, like, oh, this was. This one was reviewed, this one wasn't. Or is it more of like, hey, we need this as reference in case someone comes back and, like, ask for it?  \nThem: It's more just reference. Although then that leads me to my next point. When we get an account for the first time, we receive tons and tons of media because it's all the media for that account.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: However, if for the legal process, there's something that is missing that we're going to need within court, we can request one to two pieces of media for one account, and once that media is fulfilled and given to us by the client, it comes in those big, giant batches of new media as well. And we have no way to track that. So we have to. Currently, we're manually looking at one spreadsheet that says something's been rejected because we're missing a piece of media. We then have to go into the account to double check and FlowBuilder sure that we did request it. If it's been requested over a couple weeks, then we have to open up a new spreadsheet to then see what the client said about it. If the client said they fulfilled it. Then we have to go into paper vision and see did we actually receive it. So. We're getting it. There's just nothing. That one piece that's requested is in all that big batch of media that's tens of thousands, and we have no way to easily track that. Now, it's pretty manual.  \nMe: I mean, could you walk me through, like, when you say, like, pretty manual, like, are you just, like, having to, like, sit there and, like, scroll and, like, read, like, doing searches? Like, what is that? What does that actually look like?  \nThem: Yeah. I use the search. Bar. I use the search bar. But, yeah, that's the only other thing I can think is we pull a list of everything we're waiting on and, oh, did we receive it today?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: That's kind of what we're doing right now.  \nMe: Okay? I mean, that that is something we should definitely be able to do, of course, with all of these kind of things, like the devils and the details. But if you have existing spreadsheets for these, if there are, like, files that work, I guess. One question I have. I know when we were talking sort of about the, the actual, like, legal sort of, like, filing process. We were like, hey, we don't want to use AI in processing these for potentially legal reasons. Is this a place where there'd be appetite? Assuming, you know, if something. We have all the right security guidelines. Like, we're not training on your data and all that jazz. Is this a place I could see, like, doing some of this summarization? Because it sounds like there's at least a little bit of. I don't want to say judgment because that, like, robots don't have judgment, but there's like, a little bit of judgment involved in terms of, hey, these are. The actual types of documents, because it's not necessarily like, oh, it's like this exact name. It'll, like, need to open it and look at it. Like, does this have the. Have what we need? Like, all that kind of stuff? Is that the right way to think about it?  \nThem: Good. How are you? Yeah. So when it comes to us, it does come in all different types of naming conventions. It may not be actually written what the item is, of course, but it James have the account number. And even if technically they send us not what we're looking for, even just knowing there's something there to review would be great. In which case, in my head I'm thinking only needs to look at the name of this document. Starts with this account number and this account number is waiting for something.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah, I think that'd be doable.  \nMe: That piece of lease is super, super doable. That account number is there. And, like, what we would probably do either it sounds like you guys are a Microsoft shop, so maybe we'd probably have, like, an online Excel spreadsheet where it's like, hey, the automation triggers. We. It, like, adds a road to that. List of like, hey, this is something we're looking for. And then you have an automation set up with, like, the inbox that is coming in. And every time something comes into that inbox, it'll do, like, an intake process. If it's a, you know, net new customer, it'll like, hey, let's add them to the list. Pull it in if it's like. If it's on the list of things that we're waiting for. It can, like, check that, then send you guys an alert based off of what you what, like, you know, whatever that specific update is that it was waiting for. Yeah, okay. Ton of sense.  \nThem: Does that sound helpful? Sadie. Yeah. Because. Like I said, we know we're waiting on all the media for new accounts. So we know when to review those. We can easily see that we got. We already have it. Reporting on a spreadsheet.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: For again, this brand new account James say it has. It'll have a number for how many pieces of media we have for that then we know to review, but for the old media that we have to request, and we're waiting on that. That's what's really killing us, because there's a lot that we're waiting on. And then, like I said, we manually have to go through, so I think that would be really helpful.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: It sounds like you understand what I'm saying.  \nMe: I think. One sort of follow up question here. Could you give me, like, how much time are you spending on this in, like a given week? Is this like, is this like an hour activity? Are you spending, like, is it an hour every day activity? Just like order of magnitude? Like, what does this actually take for you guys to do?  \nThem: But is it an hour a day you think is what you can allot to it? How much does it take every time? Like, what is it like profile or per look? Or even if you break it down by. Yeah, we're currently doing it. About how currently you're doing it? About an hour a day. That's the review of it. But things are getting backed up with us working on an hour a day.  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Got it.  \nMe: Like, half an hour a day, but because you have other stuff you need to do that. It's just like a constant background that builds up.  \nThem: We need more time. Got it.  \nMe: Okay? And maybe, like, dumb question, but, like, does it matter if there's a backlog? Like, does it. Does it, like, slow down your ability to, like, generate revenue with those clients? Is it just, like, mildly inconvenient? Like, what's the. What's. What happens if, like, you don't get to something? Like weeks later other than you would otherwise.  \nThem: Oh, no. This is one of those items where on our call Tuesday, I said the client say other people already have this automated. We are backed up. So our first step of the process is demanding a consumer. That's who we're eventually going to sue if they don't pay us. And if we can't get that demand out, then we can't go to the legal process. Then we can't go. We can't get money. So, yeah, we aren't even allowed to accept money if they know we have the account until after we do that first demand, in which case we review. All the media. We FlowBuilder sure it matches the account. So, yeah, it's holding up money revenue. All that the client tracks it and knows. Hey, you're three, four weeks late on this.  \nMe: Okay? That makes a ton of sense. Could you. One thread that I'm curious about, could you walk me a little bit through, like, what is that? Like, whole client onboarding process look like, like, when a new client joins, like, what are, what are like. And I get more in the vein of, like, what are there any parts? Of that process that are like, hey, we do this same step every time. If we had some more intelligent automation, it might FlowBuilder. FlowBuilder this easier, give us more capacity to bring on new clients, any of that kind of stuff.  \nThem: And I James just drop a preface. How often do we get a new client? I don't think we've had many.  \nMe: Yeah, maybe that's a better question.  \nThem: Yeah. Well, are you speaking of a new client? We only have about 20 clients.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: But those 20 clients laid thousands of accounts to sue. And one of our clients. As we were told on a call Yesterday, we have 16,000 placements for this one client.  \nMe: Gotcha. So in those. Those placements are when they have to send over those, like, documents that we were talking about. It's like, is the placement the unit of. Work there. Okay, Sorry. I think I meant placements then, and not clients. That's.  \nThem: There you go. Well, like any other Alex their client is. They have more clients. We have hours are businesses.  \nMe: Yeah, makes sense.  \nThem: But no, I. Fix it. So what they do is they have a file and they're all different formats. But they have a file. Our system CLS can read majority of those files, in which case we click a couple numbers, we give it the file, it does everything itself. However, there are a few clients that CLS does not read their formatting. And someone manually has to copy and paste into a template. Currently. So those are our smaller clients. So I guess I haven't thought of it as too much of a pain point, but that certainly could be.  \nMe: It might be something we can take off your plate, right? Like, even if it's not a huge, huge lift, right? It just, like, don't have to worry about it anymore. Okay? Okay? Okay? That makes sense then. Okay, great. You mentioned. So there were some other things that you said you had on your list as well. What are. What are some of those other activities that you.  \nThem: So we're going to. Stick with media for a minute.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: Or I guess document copies. So. When we do demand an account, that is a letter that goes to the consumer, when we get filed with the court, when we get a judgment filed with court, all these things that are getting filed and or sent to the consumer. We have to. And we send them back to the client. This is another thing that the clients have specifically said, why are you late on this? And say, well, we pull manually. They say, well, Everyone else has automated.  \nMe: Eah.  \nThem: But in Paper Vision, our system, Paper Vision is where everything is saved after it gets scanned in. We have a pretty decent process for that already, where when it's scanned, it is automatically named and uploaded. But then from there, But, I mean, we're demanding hundreds of accounts, suing hundreds of accounts per day. And so then that's then half a thousand to one thousand pieces of media per day that should be getting sent back to the client. And we currently are manually pulling it, manually renaming it, and then manually moving it to the correct folder, zipping it and placing it in an FTP.  \nMe: O. Kay. There's multiple steps of this process. It sounds like some. There's a piece of. We are printing and scanning these. Some of our competitors are maybe using, like, a DocuSign or a Panda doc to, like, do some of these documents. So there's not, like, the printing and scanning involved. Once they are scanned in paper vision, there's some of those are automatically named and updated, but there's like, about 500 to a thousand pieces of media per, like, day that you're having to map back to paper vision. Is that correct?  \nThem: Everything goes up into paper vision.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: In a process that I think is already good and clean. Us pulling it back down from Paper Vision. Because other than that, it would be super manual like me scanning it to Paper Vision. I would then have to scan a separate copy to save it in a folder somewhere. So everything goes into Paper Vision. That's the first step. That's good, but pulling it back down now. We're not going one by one. We do have a bulk process to do these things, but that's still timely.  \nMe: And I would.  \nThem: Where we can pull more. No, you're good.  \nMe: Ask you. You mentioned like you're doing a bulk process. And I mean, like, is. Would it be fair to say you have, like, limited visibility? Like, if. If in that bulk, like, One of the 500 is, like, a mistake for some reason, like, you just, like, wouldn't know, or am I thinking about that wrong?  \nThem: You wouldn't know. I think automation also wouldn't know too. So when we have something uploaded to Paper Vision for the most part, not for all parts, but for the most part, if it's a judgment, we have an image code and it's going to be I JDG for a suit, which also can be said of petition It's I, P, E, T. That's the image code that it's given. So that's how you can pull multiple account numbers and pull only one document. So for each. Account number.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: So we do that right now. And yeah, if someone saved it under the wrong image code, that human error and I'm not opening. There could be error there.  \nMe: I mean, not necessarily. I'm not necessarily saying there are, but it's just with if people are, if I understand correctly, if people are, like, manually doing this, because, like, some people, like, you know, just FlowBuilder mistakes, the more, the more of those that you're doing, every. There James be some percentage of mistakes, right? As you're just having to work through that. Okay? Okay.  \nThem: Of. Course. So it's almost as if the workflow or the automation can actually read the file type from the name and then place it where it properly needs to go. I think that might be a huge savings. Is that correct? Is that fair to say? Yes. Yes, and then renaming takes a while too. We do have, I think Kurt likes to use a PowerShell window. I have an Excel sheet with a macro on it that renames these things, but it's still setting up the formula to get the right naming convention, copying and pasting, waiting for it to load. So. We do have decent processes where it's not one by one, but I would imagine manual.  \nMe: Yeah. That makes sense. And I mean, I James just pause because I want to sort of give you guys kudos on even building that, like, because, like, you're. You're. You're working within the constraints of what you have. You're like, hey, we're getting more and more volume. We need to, like. FlowBuilder this work. Like, what can I do? What tools do I have? And you. I. I've worked in, like, Fortune 10 companies, and you'd be surprised how much of their things are running on just Excel on the background. So, like, it's. It's. I don't want you to undermine the like. Quality of what you're doing. Just because, you know, AutomateFlow is an automation platform, right? It'll be easier. But, like, that doesn't mean the work you guys are doing so far hasn't been incredible. I just want to, like, frame that.  \nThem: Facts.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay?  \nThem: So they could definitely, you know, usually an automation, you could pull it in, pull in whatever media, pull in that document. By the file name, do any type of transformation to it, and then output it to a certain folder. With the new naming structure. I don't think that's beyond.  \nMe: Yeah, that should be. That's not very easy. Not hard at all. And we should definitely be able to implement that. Okay? So it sounds like if going back. So it sounds like the overall like media tracking maybe is what I would call that first one of like, hey, how do we know like the media is actually being followed up with that's actually sent over without us having to go manually check. Then this one is like the. Again, I'm probably thinking butchering the wording here, but, like, maybe we call this one like, document processing, or like, like digital document processing, where it's like, hey, we need to rename these documents that we're getting. We need to move them from these different systems and. Then I imagine there's like, what do you do, like, once you, Once you send. Do you have to, like, do you send an email to the clients about it? Do you, like, what do you, like, do with the information, like, once you actually pull it down? Or not pull down, but, like, update it.  \nThem: To be proactive. We don't have to alert them to anything we upload either to an FTP or to a site, depending on who our client is that we're working on. And they should get their notices there that everything's done.  \nMe: Ok?  \nThem: We are working a bit reactively right now, in which case they have to ask for media instead of already having it.  \nMe: Ay, I'm fine.  \nThem: Our system cls we do place a code on the file once we have saved something that way. Like currently we have reporting that says we'll use a judgment. A judgment was filed, which means we should have the copy. Therefore, it goes on a list to find the copy. That's when we do the bulk school. And then once we have it pulled and send it to the client, then we do also do a code. So we have some tracking as well, but again, still manually.  \nMe: Okay? That makes a ton of sense. I'm trying, I'm trying to think if I have any other follow up questions. I think this is, I think this gives me like a pretty good clear picture at least for these two use cases. And I like the next step on these. I think for Charles and I to maybe talk with like either a solutions architect on our side. And I guess the one ask I would have is, if it's easy, could you. If you could pull examples of those spreadsheets, like, any screenshots you have of those, like, steps that you guys are talking about, and that'll help us, like, get into, like, the mechanics of, like. Like, how actually do we need to FlowBuilder sure this stuff is flowed together? Because, yeah, like I said earlier, the overall structure makes a lot of sense. We have customers doing similar things, but the devil's always in the details. In terms of, like, how do we actually connect to your systems, what does the data flows, all that kind of stuff.  \nThem: And I'm not pie tower reports either. They need to be fixed too. So maybe looking at them and pairing them together. Maybe that all needs to be done at once. Maybe we can use what we have and update it later. But, yeah, I can get those screenshots of what they look like now. Or I can even redact some things and just send you the file if you'd rather that.  \nMe: That works. I'm also. I'm also happy we can sign an NDA on our side as well, if that would be helpful, just in terms of, like, sharing documents and stuff like that.  \nThem: If they tell me I can send stuff, then I'll send stuff. If not.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah. I don't mind either way. I mean, eventually I would think you all are seeing everything anyways. Okay, so then, any more questions with media movement? That's the coming in and going back out.  \nMe: I don't think so. And that doesn't mean there James be a few days from now I won't ping you again, but yeah.  \nThem: Okay? Of course. And then also. We did kind of already talk about how do we get our placements. And I said that CLS reads the file. All that's, like, good and dandy. Except for. So we currently have an automation that pulls the file from the FTP. That's just movement of a file. Like a text file. And then. It, uploads it to the system. Something keeps happening where it's not happening. And that's really big because either it's a whole placement or we have multiple import files that we get daily that might not have a new placement, therefore a brand new account, but it's an update on an account we already have. That's really important. Some of these have direct payments, so maybe instead of the consumer paying us. They have paid the client, and the client's relaying that to us. And all that is in these import files.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: And they don't get uploaded. Efficient. Or correctly every time.  \nMe: Yeah. I mean, could you. Could you maybe expand a little bit? Like, is this, like, once a month we're missing one or two? Is it, like, every day we're running it? Like, some of them aren't coming through? Like, could you talk to me a bit about.  \nThem: So multiple are coming through a day. I James say. Three or four per week are not getting imported the way they should.  \nMe: Okay? Okay?  \nThem: And by the way, they're not getting imported at all.  \nMe: Gotcha. So order of magnitude. You said around, like, 20. Like, you said like three or four per day and been, like, basically, like one day's worth of them is, like, not coming through. As expected as you need them to. Or at all, like you were saying.  \nThem: Yeah, but then, see, I feel like. With the knowledge I do have of it, which is not much, I would think a whole day missing, you can figure out what happened, but we haven't been able to figure out what's happening. With automation not working because.  \nMe: Random ones.  \nThem: In one day. We get five of these files that need to be imported. We get them all at once. We go to import them all at once, and one gets missed. That needs to be edited, or maybe putting them instead of the automation system we have already.  \nMe: And I imagine that, like, almost creates. It creates more work because you almost don't trust it anymore, right? Because, like, now you're like, every day, you're like, hey, I have to. I have to double check because this might just be one of the things that we lose, right?  \nThem: Time consuming, double checking. You have to open up this file. It's like coding with inside of the file. So I have to think about which file I'm looking at and if I know what the format is so I can find the file number which is next to all these other numbers, and then I have to actually see if what's supposed to be imported. Got imported. And so, I mean, even double checking is extremely. Meaningful.  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Therefore, they're still being missed, because I can't do that every day.  \nMe: Yeah. That makes sense. Okay?  \nThem: And then the same goes for our export. So however we receive a file like per client, they have their own format. Some clients utilize the same formatting. But we also cls. You type in a code in cls and. It produces a file that we then send back to the client the same way they just sent us a file. That's not always happening either. And that's supposed to be currently set up as an automation. To pull the file. Some days it's pulling the file, but not moving it to the FTP as it should. Some days it's not creating the file at all. And so, I mean, we're having both import and export problems. And like I said, these are the same file types within per client. They're the same file types as just whether or not we're receiving or sending out the information.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Makes sense. Okay? Imports and export to files. Like, that's. Yeah. That's huge. And if I understand potentially clarifying question, are these also media files or is this a different type of file? This is just like the list of, like, claimants, right, that you. That you might be. That you might have.  \nThem: This is like a text file, and inside of it has the account number, the note. They want to give us a code that relays to that note. It'll have balance adjustments, things like that. Yeah, it's just a text file with information inside of it.  \nMe: And then separately, you get. Because each of these, like, might have media associated with it, you'll separately get a file that says, hey, this is the media. And here's like, a number with the account number that tells you, like, to tie these two together.  \nThem: Yes. So at placement that happens because that placement, hey, here's these 20. Brand new account comes in an import file and then media James get 20 files per 20. So what's that, 400. We'll get 400 pieces of media that gets dropped for that. A few times a month, we get one single client places over 700 accounts at once, and so that ends up being like 20,000 pieces of media. But yes.  \nMe: Okay? And then maybe like. Could we maybe paint the picture of, like, the future world? Like, if you. If you were to just be like, hey, if I. If my. If this worked, ideally. Every. Like what? What would your interaction look like? What information would you have available about what customers are sending you? Like, just, you know, assuming you had a blank slate, you could do whatever you want. Like what would. Just talk to me a bit about what that would look like in the good world.  \nThem: When it comes to imports and exports. Honestly, I don't want to see it. I just want to know that it works.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Currently, we don't see it unless we know there's an issue. I'm purposely going into the folder that I know they're saved in and double checking them. But before these started breaking, or rather the person who uploaded them, I think knew they were breaking and knew how to double check, but now it's separate departments, and that's a whole thing. Imports and exports should be like, out of sight, out of mind.  \nMe: Yeah, he just never have to think. It's like. No, it's working.  \nThem: If it breaks a notice for that.  \nMe: Sure.  \nThem: But no, we'd be just getting notification after notification, probably like 20 per day saying that it uploaded, so I don't want to see those.  \nMe: Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I mean, what we'd probably do is, like, hey, either we'd probably just, like, save a list of, like, these are the ones. And so if. If you get a notification somewhere that something broke or for some reason a customer's like, hey, we didn't get something. We were expecting you can. It's easy to go back and check it without you having to, like, do a bunch of that kind of stuff.  \nThem: There probably should be like running list saying, this works, this works, this work, this didn't. But as far as. Should anyone need to check or review it daily? No, but I think, yeah, having something there to be able to review would be probably needed. Probably needed for audit purposes or something.  \nMe: Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. Okay? I think I really sorry. I realize we're over time, but I think this. This is at least online. I think it's been super helpful to like, understand your guys use case here. I don't think there's necessarily tactical next steps on your end, but Charles and I, I think, have some work to actually, no, that's not true. I think the tactical next step is for you to send me some of the, like, spreadsheets, some of the documents that you guys are working through, and. Then Charles and I sort of are taking the to do to, like, try to, like, actually map this out, figure out any, like, additional questions we might have. Yeah.  \nThem: How are you on time, sweetie? Oh, I'm. Good. Do you have a hard stop, Alex?  \nMe: I don't think so. Let me check.  \nThem: I think you're free to 11, right?  \nMe: Yeah. Yep. Yep. Free toe weapon. We have time.  \nThem: Do you want to keep going?  \nMe: Do you have? Yeah. Do you have more. Do you have more use cases?  \nThem: I. Want a whole list, but those are the two inputs, and exports is, like, the most important priority, I guess. And I figured it should be fairly easy. Me not doing any work at all. Saying it'll be easy.  \nMe: But no.  \nThem: And then media move. Media movement isn't, like, the highest priority, but I figured if we start stomping out the easier ones, since we do have workarounds for all of this, but we don't want to do the work around. I figure we do the easiest things first. That way, within whatever amount of time we can have five to 10 done versus two or three. Because they're more thought out, we can save them more thought out things for later. So I think I'm good with just starting with these two.  \nMe: I mean, let's just run. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: I also need to. What's up?  \nMe: I was going to say, let's. If you. We can just run down. If you can sort of, like, read off the list, because, like, at least we can, like, have it in the back of, like, hey. These are things we're working towards. And part of, I think, is the benefit there is. Depending on what some of those future things are, it might inform design decisions on this stuff, if that makes sense, like, in terms of, like, how we want to FlowBuilder sure it can, like, integrate broader stuff.  \nThem: Okay? For affidavits. If we currently set up an automation right now just to pull our affidavit. And then send it. It's not going to work. So this would be a full whole project where we need. We on our side are going to need to clean up our templates. And we're going to have to review scripts on our side to FlowBuilder sure everything's at time, like this is a full project. That I think we would have to clean up first. When we demand an account, that's our first letter going to the consumer saying, we'll see you if you don't pay. Right after we send that demand, we should be requesting an affidavit from our client. For clients that just simply want to be told, hey, here's a request. We have automatic coding, ncls already. All that works great. Although if the exports aren't working, then they don't get our codes. But barring that, all that works. However, there are other clients that we have to produce. Affidavit. In which case we have a template. We place a code on cls, it fills out that template for us. But then. We have to add a few pieces of media. And then we have to rename it, and then we have to send it back up to the client. This is something else that clients have said that others have automated where I would imagine as soon as you get the demand code, a document's produced, renamed, saved and uploaded back. So that's one thing I want. To eventually look at. I'm trying to think of what else? I have a notebook. List. Can't find which page my list is on last.  \nMe: And sorry, follow up question on the affidavit. 1. Could you talk to me a bit about, like, Maybe like, why this wouldn't be higher on the priority list? Because my initial reaction is like, this seems. This seems like potentially pretty impactful. And definitely understand that it might be a little more complex. But like, if I think about basically in my head, I have like a two by two matrix of like, difficulty and like, impact of it, and this would be higher on difficulty, but it seems like if we could get this working for you guys, it would be really meaningful.  \nThem: I think there's a lot we would have to do on our side first.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Time consuming to update everything to FlowBuilder it ready for automation. And I don't know that we have the manpower or time, but see if we get these easier things done first.  \nMe: Then it's easier to justify that investment.  \nThem: Then. That gives us some time to work on these things. That are going to take more time. That was my thought. I think it would just be great for us to have better reporting. To separate out. Like, this is a date. We got this placement because our clients do this and we're currently not. And we don't have any spreadsheets that are doing this for us either. I can do it with a SQL query and move some things around and figure it out. But if something can just shout it at me that this is what's going on. That'd be ideal. But I want to be able to know this placement for this client. We got 700 at once. How many of these? Within two months, they should be at suit. So how many of these are actually at suit and, like, bar graphs and stuff? That's what a lot of our clients have, our bar graph that I utilize, but not all clients have that. Our largest client. Does not have any interface that we can see of theirs. Only our smaller clients have that. So then that doesn't really. Yeah, that doesn't really help us that much. But on the smaller clients, I've been able to see it happen, and I like it. There's bar graphs saying. Well, you have this many of this for this placement, and it just tracks where you are at in the movement, so you can kind of see more outside. What's going on right now? We're going accounts by account. And that's not doable. Trying to think. Kurt. Eventually when we. Finish. We need to work. On our. Once we. Continue to work on.  \nMe: Sorry. I'm having trouble hearing Kurt.  \nThem: Probably. Is.  \nMe: Oh, on jail. Sorry. I heard you say I apologize.  \nThem: No, you just got to move the phone a little closer, that's all. Sorry. Who's the other printer? I think we need to. As Katie was mentioning, there's a little bit of work on our side that needs to be done. We have a linked hardship and dispute. Section that we probably James need to work, but when we rework it, On our end with reworking certain codes. I imagine we would probably want to start some automation with going. Out with the documents that need to be linked to the code and just. Have that automated going. Forward. But I think that's also another thing. That you would need more time to be able to rework those things on our side so they would be ready for. You.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: I think that's all that I have for now.  \nMe: For sure. I mean, and definitely, if, like, if you're just, like, noodling, if something comes up, just, like, feel free to, like, in, in the. Just reply, be like, oh, this is another thing that, that we thought of, but this is, this gives us a lot to work with. And it sounds like, okay, there's a couple of different things. The affidavit piece that you just mentioned, the inboard reporting you just mentioned. But the most important things in the near term are going to be just getting that input output just, like, clean. So you just don't have to worry about it. Right. Like, it works, you know, it's working. You don't, you don't have to look at that anymore. And then the media transition pieces, like, how can we FlowBuilder that process easier and less manual for you guys to avoid the, like, backlog continuing to build up over time of, like, media that has to be processed?  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yes. And then once those free up some of our time, we can get into the more complex things. I do have quite a few more things, but if I don't have them written down,  \nMe: For sure.  \nThem: I'm just going to tongue tie myself trying to say it out loud. So I'll FlowBuilder sure I get that done for maybe next time we meet. Did you want to ask him about a hub spot?  \nMe: Oh, yeah.  \nThem: I've watched our clients have these productivity sites and have all these bar graphs and all this, and it just looks so clean and easy to read. I don't know if SalesCloud works like that. We were using SalesCloud, but only the free trial, and so I hated it. I don't know if that was just because we didn't have all the bells and whistles that we were able to use. But when you brought up SalesCloud in the meeting, just saying that it was an app that you can easily pair with. SalesCloud is, like, where we save all of our client information. And Mr. Eastpoint enjoyed it. So I didn't know what more it had that can help us other than just communications. Currently we really only use it as an address book.  \nMe: Yeah. So I can actually pull some details on this, but there's lots of, like, really good reporting features in SalesCloud. There are. I could be wrong about this. I'll have to double check, but I think they're like an entire, what they would call, like, services management, like, functions in the system. So you can track, like, oh, like, we got this many, like, of the placements that we came in, and, like, this is what happened to them. And, like, you have that flow that you can track through. I don't think I've used SalesCloud for that specific use case, but I know they have it, or I'm pretty certain they have it. So I can do some digging, and then if it's. If it's interesting, we do partner with them quite a bit. I could probably pull someone in from SalesCloud to just, like, talk to you a bit about, like, what, what it entails. You can ask them, ask them more specific questions because they'll have a much better sense of that. But it also just may be that maybe that's a part of, also a part of the things we look at. Later, once we have some of these, like, initial use cases built up.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Okay? That sounds good. I'm telling you, I didn't like it, but I was like, maybe that's just because we don't have all the extra bells and whistles. All we're using it is as an adjust book. Because when we talked about it, you kind of mentioned maybe, like, tracking clients and giving you some more detail around the client. Right. I just wanted to try to FlowBuilder sure I least give them the right frame of reference as to why it even kind of came about in our conversation. Yeah. And I mean, if they have that.  \nMe: Wait. Clarifying. Question the clients, but not placement. So this is like. This would be like, the 20 clients you're working with, you're tracking in SalesCloud, not the, like, thousands of placements.  \nThem: Report. Well, that's what we currently have only used it for, because for our clients, we talked to three or four people per client. That worked there and. As an address book that way. But if they have reporting, then I would imagine we.  \nMe: Yeah. I mean.  \nThem: Can track our place and things like that.  \nMe: 100%. Because, like, my, what my where my brain initially goes is what you would, is what you would do is effectively, like, keep the placements as the contacts. Like, I'm sure you would have your company like the companies as well, but, like, the, the contacts would be like the people doing the placements and. There would be, like, fields on that of like, oh, we've gotten the original affidavit. Oh, we've, like, have the media here and you could attach the media to the item in SalesCloud and, like, that's all things. Like, we have a lot of customers who use AutomateFlow to. Connect to those, like, visual pieces in SalesCloud, but they're also transparently, lots of tools that do this kind of thing. So if SalesCloud specifically is like, hey, we've tried this, we don't like it, like, getting you that visibility is something we can do. In different of SalesCloud.  \nThem: Yeah. No, I don't think we would want any media or anything in there. Because that would be all panda, Doc.  \nMe: Yes, but what I guess what I was saying is what you could do is you could, like, tie, like, tag the PandaDoc documents. To the SalesCloud contact. So you would have, like, one of the. One of the people that you're, like, reaching out to. Like, hey, you send them a demand letter. That demand letter is like, the demander itself isn't DocuSign, but there's a link attached to the SalesCloud thing. So you can, like, easily find it. And then. And then what that allows you to do is, like, summarize across all of them. Like, it could just, like, roll up and be like, hey, like, okay, we have the demand letters for these. We've sent out the affidavit for these. Like, that kind of thing. But again, doesn't necessarily. Have to be SalesCloud, like lots of tools. Do that.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Okay, awesome.  \nThem: That sounds good. Okay? Anything else. For me.  \nMe: I don't think so. Travel. See any. Anything else you want to FlowBuilder sure we ask about while we. While we have the time?  \nThem: Pretend to serve as a break. They do a lot. They deserve some help. So I'm excited. To see what we can bring about for sure.  \nMe: Awesome. Thanks. I'll send. I'll send an email after this. Just recapping and then laying out this couple of specific things that if you could send me and Charles to start thinking about the mechanics of this. But, Sadie, great to meet you. And. Sorry, I thought I heard. I didn't hear what your name was. Oh, it is Kurt. Oh, okay. Sorry. Sorry. I thought. Never mind. Okay. Okay? Kurt Sadie. Kurt. Great. Great to meet both of you. Excited for the chance to help you guys FlowBuilder your FlowBuilder your work easier. And feel free to like, ping me as a resource if you like. I know you said you have, like, other things if you just think of them just like, just like shoot them over in emails as you think of them, and I'll do the work of making sure they're organized and all that jazz.  \nThem: Okay? Have a great.  \nMe: Cool. Thanks, guys. Talk to you later. Have a great day.  \nThem: Thank you. Thanks, sadie. Thanks, Craig. All right. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/...

Like, hey, just kind of explain to me what is hard about your process. Like, what would you want to do differently? Like, if you could. If you. And not necessarily saying we can do this, but, like, just sort of, like, I want you to be in the mindset of, like, if you could wave a magic wand and, like, this is how my process would be. Like, this is what it would take for me to do. This is the information we would have available to, like, FlowBuilder better decisions. Just walk me a bit through that and then we can. Then I think the idea is, like, me and Charles go and figure out some of, like, the technical capabilities. Behind that, but that's high level, what we're thinking about."

And before an inventory got insane. Oh, it takes a minute a day to drag and drop this media. Now there are tens of thousands of PDF documents that have to be moved per day. That takes time to load and we're having to unzip it, then move it, those kinds of things. There is already an automation in process, but then sometimes it breaks. So I don't know if that's something we would then want to update as well, but there is already an automation in process where we move our media to is a folder in our system. Off the computer, and an automation moves that up to. Our. What is paper Vision? A software or website? That's where we store everything that everyone can review it and see it.

And we have no way to track that. So we have to. Currently, we're manually looking at one spreadsheet that says something's been rejected because we're missing a piece of media. We then have to go into the account to double check and FlowBuilder sure that we did request it. If it's been requested over a couple weeks, then we have to open up a new spreadsheet to then see what the client said about it. If the client said they fulfilled it.

Something keeps happening where it's not happening. And that's really big because either it's a whole placement or we have multiple import files that we get daily that might not have a new placement, therefore a brand new account, but it's an update on an account we already have. That's really important. Some of these have direct payments, so maybe instead of the consumer paying us. They have paid the client, and the client's relaying that to us.

In which case we have a template. We place a code on cls, it fills out that template for us. But then. We have to add a few pieces of media. And then we have to rename it, and then we have to send it back up to the client.

So how many of these are actually at suit and, like, bar graphs and stuff? That's what a lot of our clients have, our bar graph that I utilize, but not all clients have that. Our largest client. Does not have any interface that we can see of theirs. Only our smaller clients have that. So then that doesn't really. Yeah, that doesn't really help us that much. But on the smaller clients, I've been able to see it happen, and I like it. There's bar graphs saying. Well, you have this many of this for this placement, and it just tracks where you are at in the movement, so you can kind of see more outside. What's going on right now?

All we're using it is as an adjust book. Because when we talked about it, you kind of mentioned maybe, like, tracking clients and giving you some more detail around the client. Right. I just wanted to try to FlowBuilder sure I least give them the right frame of reference as to why it even kind of came about in our conversation. Yeah. And I mean, if they have that."

          "text": "100%. Because, like, my, what my where my brain initially goes is what you would, is what you would do is effectively, like, keep the placements as the contacts. Like, I'm sure you would have your company like the companies as well, but, like, the, the contacts would be like the people doing the placements and. There would be, like, fields on that of like, oh, we've gotten the original affidavit. Oh, we've, like, have the media here and you could attach the media to the item in SalesCloud and, like, that's all things. Like, we have a lot of customers who use AutomateFlow to. Connect to those, like, visual pieces in SalesCloud, but they're also transparently, lots of tools that do this kind of thing. So if SalesCloud specifically is like, hey, we've tried this, we don't like it, like, getting you that visibility is something we can do. In different of SalesCloud."

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yes, but what I guess what I was saying is what you could do is you could, like, tie, like, tag the PandaDoc documents. To the SalesCloud contact. So you would have, like, one of the. One of the people that you're, like, reaching out to. Like, hey, you send them a demand letter. That demand letter is like, the demander itself isn't DocuSign, but there's a link attached to the SalesCloud thing. So you can, like, easily find it. And then. And then what that allows you to do is, like, summarize across all of them. Like, it could just, like, roll up and be like, hey, like, okay, we have the demand letters for these. We've sent out the affidavit for these. Like, that kind of thing. But again, doesn't necessarily. Have to be SalesCloud, like lots of tools. Do that."

How's it going?  \nThem: Hi. How's it going?  \nMe: Good. Great to be. Glad to be.  \nThem: Yeah, likewise.  \nMe: I know. Basically I wanted to use the time to walk you through just the context on the Eastpoint deal that I added you to. Yes or. Well, I asked for an essay and then you got added to before that. I would love to just do a few minutes of intros. I can tell you a bit about my background.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah.  \nMe: Interest, like that kind of stuff. Hear a bit about you and your background and how you would zap that kind of stuff.  \nThem: Sure.  \nMe: If that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. I'm like, if that's what you want, then sure.  \nMe: My background. I've been at AutomateFlow for about four months and joined on the end of the core AE team. I think. As you know, we just got merged with former Emerging, so now we're sort of mid market. Before that I spent my career in a mix of consulting and tech work, so I was at Bain for a couple years before undergrad in private equity for all of six months and was like, I hate. This is not for me. At a company called turbonomic, which was an IT infrastructure company, where I was effectively chief of staff to the CRO in that position, and that was sort of my first exposure. To sales as a function, and pretty much since then, I've been trying to get into the seat I'm in now, but I don't even say unfortunately. So I did that for about a year and a half, went to business school for two years. Bain paid for that, so I owed them. Two years after that. So I spent the last two years before September at Bain, was in Atlanta, moved here in Texas, and now I am here, Austin.  \nThem: Yeah. Not for me. We're in texas. Oh, awesome. So nice there.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where are you based out of?  \nThem: Seattle.  \nMe: Very cool. I've actually not been. I've heard good things about it, except in the winter. I've heard it's terrible, but, like.  \nThem: Yeah, in the winter. And the winter is long. The winner's, like, you know, eight months or something. No, it's. It's lovely. The summer is absolute perfection. Like, can't beat it. Like, perfect weather every day, and it's, like a really wonderful city, but, yeah, I mean. We kind of joke that people. People go through a summer and it's so nice. And then when it's over, it gets into the rainy season. And then by the time you're right at the end of the rainy season, people are like this, I have to get out of here. I need to move. I need to leave. And then summer comes back and they're like, actually, it's really nice. I'm gonna stay. So it's like this terribly, like, masochistic cycle, you know? But, like, just when you've had enough, like, it's like, okay, I'll get warm again, you know?  \nMe: Yeah. 100%. I spent a couple years in Boston. It's the same kind of thing there, where it's like. Honestly, because I moved there during winter and I was like, why do people live here? This is terrible.  \nThem: Uncle, it's cold.  \nMe: And then summer came. I was like, Oh, okay.  \nThem: Nice. Yeah.  \nMe: Very cool.  \nThem: Right.  \nMe: How in seattle.  \nThem: On. Seattle. We've been here. For. When did we move here? We've been here for 12 years.  \nMe: Nice.  \nThem: I'm originally from. I'm originally from, like, the middle of nowhere in the middle of Idaho. So crazy. I don't talk about it, put it that way, but, you know, let's see. Background. Well, I'm an engineer by trade. I worked in power protection for a long time, actually, which is a very, like, oddly specific, like, kind of like industrial type of sector. And then I ran.  \nMe: R like their power outages don't impact like a factory or something like that.  \nThem: Yeah, exactly. I worked for a company that makes a lot of. So if you ever driven by like a big substation, so just think big fence, lots of like, obviously electrical stuff and like a lot of power lines converge there, you know, that's substation.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: A lot of the equipment other than the stuff that you see. So, like the big, like, metal stakes and the wire. You know what I mean? But, like, the actual equipment that makes it all work. Like, I work for a company that makes that stuff.  \nMe: Visual.  \nThem: Like protective relays can formally coded components like power dividers, which is that type of stuff.  \nMe: Okay? Then how'd you end up from that to, like software?  \nThem: Yeah, good. Good question. Well, I. So I went to school in eastern Washington and. There is a. There is. It's, like, really, really small town, like Collegetown. But there's a huge power protection firm there, and it's because the founder went to school there. And, you know, it was very much like an upstart. I'm going to start this business here, but probably end up, like, migrating to the coast and then it just, like, never did. And so, yeah, so that town is literally completely employed by the university and this firm, right?  \nMe: Never did.  \nThem: And it's like a pretty. It's pretty easy to get, like, really, really decent jobs there. And so I took something. I took something right out of school, and I attended it to just be like a couple six months at the most. I was like, I just need to.  \nMe: Something.  \nThem: Have a. Yeah, I might just need to, like, not be so poor and hungry, you know, for a few months while I can, like, get my head right and then figure out if I'm going to Seattle or if I'm going to California, if I'm going to the east coast or what, you know, wherever. Somewhere, Somewhere, Wherever's next.  \nMe: Idaho.  \nThem: Yeah, but I really. I really honestly, like, loved working there. So I stayed for a couple of years, but then it was just like. I mean, like, I'm gay. I have two partners. I'm just like, I need to, like, be around humans. I was like, there are more cows here than people. That's crazy. Like, so, yeah. I've always been, like, a techie person and on the side while I was working for Schweitzer. I started just like a small consultancy that grew into like a full fledged, like, Ford Deployed Agency. So after that, I ran that for 10 years and then I ended up here.  \nMe: Very cool. Very, very cool. I feel like I like that story of, like, oh, I was, you know, did a consultancy in the nine. It up here is like, very, very common, but I feel like across AutomateFlow, it's like a lot of the people who are here.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Oh, yeah. It's. It's not even like a particular role that those people funnel to. It's just like people in marketing did that. People essays have done that, People in product have done that, People in sales. You know what I mean? It's everything, so.  \nMe: With companies. Everywhere. Yeah. Okay, fair.  \nThem: Yeah, but then.  \nMe: Question.  \nThem: Yeah. Like I said, Brett and I moved here. Maybe even more than 12. Here. I feel so old, like talking about this. Yeah. Mike and I moved over here. We met Joe. Joe's been with us for the last seven years. And we have one dog. No kids, no plans for kids. That's my whole life. There you go.  \nMe: That's like a good life.  \nThem: Yeah. It's good. Yeah. We find himself.  \nMe: Awesome. Yeah, I just want to. I, like, I. Since we hadn't met before, I just wanted to, like, start with.  \nThem: Yeah, no, no, it's totally fine. I think I've, like. I've collided with you on a call once before, but it was in a group setting, and I was just. I made a note of your voice and face. When I saw that it was you, I was like, we haven't worked on anything. Together. So I was excited for this just because, you know, it's nice.  \nMe: Yeah, it's very cool. Okay, let me share my screen. Just a one. So. I'll. I'll. Kind of trying to think where to start. So I guess we're gonna start eating. Group is a debt collection law firm based out of Louisiana. They have customers. I actually should probably figure out who their actual customers are, but they have businesses who James basically, like, be like, hey, I have someone owes me this payment. They haven't. Done it. Can you, like, go collect on this? And so they'll, like, get, like, a long laundry list of, like, 700 contacts that they have to follow up with. And they have, like, send them a demand letter. They have to, like, print the documents. Then the lawyers have to, like, do a bunch of stuff. To, like, update the courts.  \nThem: Okay? Yes.  \nMe: All that jazz.  \nThem: Desk collection in its sinus.  \nMe: They originally reached out because the state of Louisiana implemented something January 1st where they had to start e filing. Their affidavit's not the right word, but, like, basically the documents they send to the court, they have to start e filing and, like, putting those through somewhere on the website or like an API, as opposed to, like, mailing them or, like, sending them over like they were doing in the past. And so that is, like, happening has to happen. They hired. I don't want to say it. Support. Because, like, he's. He's a bit more than support, but, like, he, like, spacey someone to, like, build this automation for them, more or less. Right.  \nThem: Yeah. Is it, like, a true, like, platformer, like, works in a bunch of different systems?  \nMe: Yeah. And so he was the one who originally reached out to me. And I want to say, like, early December is kind of when we had our, like, first conversation. Since then, just to, like, give a sense of timeline. So, okay, was December. He reached out early December. We actually had our, like, first call, sort of like the week of New Year's, basically. And just fun story. Trisha was the CFO when we started and is now no longer with the firm. I honestly don't have the details on that, but they want to keep moving forward with the process, so we James, we James keep doing that.  \nThem: Yeah. They're like, we had a shakeup and we need to move on.  \nMe: Okay, but. So Charles is still there. He's like. He's acting as our. And actually, I say he's acting as. Maybe a coach is a better word than champion because I just finished the medic stuff. So he does. I don't think he has the power and authority to be a full champion. But he is, like, very invested, has the aligned incentives and all that kind of stuff, and it's like working with us to, like, sell across the org, so.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I had been working with them to build to understand this. Hey, how do we just get the automated flow process running? Then we had a call. He wanted to introduce me basically to the rest of the org, where it's like, hey, this is sort of one use case. Let's go talk to the rest of the management team like so each of the departments and what use cases do you need? So I presented in the room. It was like the two owners of the firm and then each of the department leads for these sections. It was about like 13 or so people and it was just like, hey, AutomateFlow is high level how it works. Blah, blah, blah. Is this?  \nThem: That's honestly so nice. Like he like multi threaded for you.  \nMe: Yes, it's incredible.  \nThem: Never.  \nMe: Yeah, I think he. He's very. He's very motivated to get this going. And then after that conversation yesterday, we had. We had the actual check in with the client services person, and they gave us some, like, pretty detailed technical layout of what they need. And that's when I, like. I was like, okay, I think it makes sense to pull in an essay and start to like, because we were getting into the mechanics of, like, how do these connections actually work? Like, what are the flows look like? And I was like, I don't want to push, push too far down the wrong path. And I guess just like, higher level deal context. I think the two things that, like, are really potentially up in the air that we need to nail down. One, the owners on this call asked for legal firm references. We don't have a ton, transparently, at least. I've been, like, looking for some for the last few days, and there's, like, one that seems like it might be good, and the others are either not far enough along to, like, have a good story yet, or, like, aren't actually even customers yet. Like, I look for Glee. I'm, like, legal customers. These are people who are, like, they're evaluating us, but they're not. Not using us yet. So I need to. I need to see if we even have references, and if we don't have legal references, are there, like, other types of more creative references we could do that might still be credible for this audience. So if we can't get that, I think that, like, kills the whole thing transparently. Even if we can build out some of these high level use cases,  \nThem: Yeah. Okay?  \nMe: And then the second thing we need to validate is, like, I've been talking with Charles about this roi, like, the assumptions that sit under this. How much value is this for the organization? But right now, Charles is the only one who's engaged on this. And so I think we need to get other people in. The org to agree that, like, okay, yes, like, if we are able to implement this, it's actually quite valuable for us to do.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Yeah. I'll pause there. And then I guess just super tackly in terms of, like, next steps. We're get from the conversation we had yesterday with the solutions team. They're supposed to be sending us a bunch of, like, technical details, like screenshots, example spreadsheets of what they have and like, all that kind of stuff in my thought process is like, you, me and Charles would get together and say, like, okay, what is what. What should this, like, actually look like in practice? What would it take to build? And I'm thinking we do that, and then there's the initial, like, system that they connect to the courts. And if we can do those two as sort of like a, hey, this is the proof of concept. And then we sort of build out like the laundry list of like, you know, lots and lots of external use cases that we can work towards. That's high level how I'm thinking about the deal. Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, at this stage, like, do you have a sense of. What do you have a sense of, like? What? Pre sale validation. They would need to get over the line because obviously, like, It's good to have, like, a rich use case library on the front end. But it's not a downside, but it's like a slight risk there is that they're like, well, we want to FlowBuilder sure that all this stuff works. You know what I mean? It's just like, we can't do that. It's not possible. But so based on what you've heard today and all the context that you have, like, what do you think the, like, minimum threshold that we need to meet from a technical validation standpoint?  \nMe: Yeah. I think the minimum threshold we need to meet from a technical validation is the existing, like there's contract legal system to PandaDoc workflow that they're trying to build, but there's like an API call step in there that we need to figure out. So if we can show them that, that's like, relatively. I mean, it's not, like, complex, but, like, it's. It. It takes some, like, engineering understanding to, like, FlowBuilder that work.  \nThem: Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And. And it. And they've made. They've already made an attempt at that, and that are just stuck, right?  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: Oh, okay. Okay. I misunderstood. Yeah.  \nMe: And then the second one is, I think if we can get one, and this is something I still need to validate, but I feel reasonably confident that we could say, like, hey, if we can do these two for you, get you the references, then it makes sense to, like, do the investment and move forward. But that is where transparently, that is something I need to, like, still validate.  \nThem: Okay? Okay, okay.  \nMe: With.  \nThem: Well, while you're working on that. Yeah, just. We have a. I think I saw myself added to a channel. Right.  \nMe: Yeah, it's just a deal. Just the deal Context channel. Like it. It just has what I just told you, basically.  \nThem: Yeah. Okay? Is the deck that you just showed me linked in there as well?  \nMe: It should be, but let me just re link it here for you.  \nThem: You turn. Eton like Eastpoint college.  \nMe: I think so.  \nThem: Okay? Do you already have another call scheduled? Not yet.  \nMe: Oh. Oh, sorry. With. In terms of. No, we did not have the next call schedule. With. I thought you were asking if I had the hard put this I would. I wanted to get touch base with you first before I booked the time with Charles to FlowBuilder sure we were aligned on like, what that. What that should actually look like or if. Or if that was even, like, valuable, because I know I'm still, I would say I'm so, like, learning the best way to engage with, with, like, in general. So I want to FlowBuilder sure I'm, like, using your time and, like, on ways that are actually productive versus just, like, having you be there to be there. I do think it's productive, but that was kind of the thought process.  \nThem: Anyone. Yeah. Yeah. That's so sweet. Yeah, no, that's. That's very kind. I mean, it could be either way is honestly fine at this stage. The reason is because. Oh, yeah, you got. I didn't actually look in the channel. You put a lot in. Look at you. It's weird. Reps are like. There's not a. There's not, like, a middle ground when it comes to, like, channel context. People are either really, really thorough or they're like, here's a few notes. Okay, what I would say. I'm looking at your timeline. Schedule discovery sessions with each department head or wide by department. Yeah. Because your target. Your target is. Is obviously, like a unified, like, enterprise type of offering, right? Okay.  \nMe: Yeah. Exactly.  \nThem: Okay? How about this? Let me. I don't have a lot going on today, so let me just, like, marinate in this for a minute. And then I can give you a little bit of guide. I mean, it's really up to you at the end of the day, but I can give you a little bit of guidance.  \nMe: Yeah, I would love that. I love that.  \nThem: What makes sense. Yeah, because. It's true that we can probably pretty quickly get at the, you know, the thing that they're stuck on. And that's like a perfect use of my time. That's stuff that we do all the time, and it's very, very simple. But it's also important, I think, to think about. Like, two steps up from that. Like, like the broader. Like, what should the order of operations be? To FlowBuilder sure that you have, like, the right leverage at the right time to get to the right people, even though you're very. I mean, in my opinion, you're very, very well positioned. Like, this almost never happens where someone's like, you know what? I'm going to introduce you to everyone you need to talk to. It's so nice.  \nMe: Yeah. No, I, I, I. Full transparency. I was, like, trying to position this, but I was like, hey, like, maybe, you know, maybe in, like, February, mid February, we've gotten to the point where you feel comfortable, like, introducing me to everyone. He's like, let's do it Tuesday. It's like, okay.  \nThem: You're like. I am free on Tuesday. Yeah. Okay, Perfect, perfect. Okay. All right.  \nMe: I'd appreciate that. And then, actually, the only other thing, I'll ping this to you, but I just think it might be, if it's like, as you're thinking about this, maybe helpful. Let me share my screen. Just like show this example. I use. Basically I've like built like a little like Claude code agent, so I have like, just a really, really in depth. Context, what was going on.  \nThem: Yeah. No, that's great. I did the same thing for mine, so. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/f80ab891-fb43-4ae1-b7ba-1c179d73694c](https://example.com/...

This is not for me. At a company called turbonomic, which was an IT infrastructure company, where I was effectively chief of staff to the CRO in that position, and that was sort of my first exposure. To sales as a function, and pretty much since then, I've been trying to get into the seat I'm in now, but I don't even say unfortunately. So I did that for about a year and a half, went to business school for two years. Bain paid for that, so I owed them. Two years after that.

Like, what are the flows look like? And I was like, I don't want to push, push too far down the wrong path. And I guess just like, higher level deal context. I think the two things that, like, are really potentially up in the air that we need to nail down. One, the owners on this call asked for legal firm references. We don't have a ton, transparently, at least. I've been, like, looking for some for the last few days, and there's, like, one that seems like it might be good, and the others are either not far enough along to, like, have a good story yet, or, like, aren't actually even customers yet. Like, I look for Glee. I'm, like, legal customers. These are people who are, like, they're evaluating us, but they're not. Not using us yet. So I need to. I need to see if we even have references, and if we don't have legal references, are there, like, other types of more creative references we could do that might still be credible for this audience. So if we can't get that, I think that, like, kills the whole thing transparently. Even if we can build out some of these high level use cases,"

What should this, like, actually look like in practice? What would it take to build? And I'm thinking we do that, and then there's the initial, like, system that they connect to the courts.

I wanted to get touch base with you first before I booked the time with Charles to FlowBuilder sure we were aligned on like, what that. What that should actually look like or if. Or if that was even, like, valuable, because I know I'm still, I would say I'm so, like, learning the best way to engage with, with, like, in general. So I want to FlowBuilder sure I'm, like, using your time and, like, on ways that are actually productive versus just, like, having you be there to be there. I do think it's productive, but that was kind of the thought process."

I didn't actually look in the channel. You put a lot in. Look at you. It's weird. Reps are like. There's not a. There's not, like, a middle ground when it comes to, like, channel context. People are either really, really thorough or they're like, here's a few notes. Okay, what I would say. I'm looking at your timeline. Schedule discovery sessions with each department head or wide by department. Yeah. Because your target. Your target is. Is obviously, like a unified, like, enterprise type of offering, right? Okay."

That's stuff that we do all the time, and it's very, very simple. But it's also important, I think, to think about. Like, two steps up from that. Like, like the broader. Like, what should the order of operations be? To FlowBuilder sure that you have, like, the right leverage at the right time to get to the right people, even though you're very. I mean, in my opinion, you're very, very well positioned. Like, this almost never happens where someone's like, you know what? I'm going to introduce you to everyone you need to talk to.

      "rawText": "Meeting Title: Eastpoint Capital &  Alex |  Meeting\nDate: Jan 16\nMeeting participants: Cdaniel\n\nTranscript:\n \nThem: Recording in progress. Hey there.  \nMe: Hey. Hey. How's it going?  \nThem: Lunch is very disappointing. I'm sorry. I'm still trying to process it in my head.  \nMe: Wait. What happened?  \nThem: Lunch was very disappointing. I'm still trying to process it mentally. Like now. I'm just not going to eat.  \nMe: I hate when that happens. What do you. What do you have? What were you.  \nThem: I'm on this Cdaniel fast, right, with my church, and it's like, all right, well, we can't really have a meat and seafood and all of the things, right? So I'm like, you get a veggie sushi roll.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: It's a poly Carrots. That's all it is. Literally just carrots in a cucumber wrap. I'm like,  \nMe: Oh, my God.  \nThem: This was a terrible. I could have just got a salad like this. Is, I can't eat this. I'm looking at the bag, I'm like,  \nMe: Call that a. Why even call that a sushi roll?  \nThem: Call it a carrot roll. That's what it is. Maybe one piece of asparagus in it, but I can't eat this. He was like, well, we do put a little avocado, but since you got the cucumber and all the things, I'm like, all right. Now I'm just hangry anyway. After spending $18.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah, that 18 could have just gone so many other places, honestly. Anyway.  \nMe: That's all. That always sucks. I hate it. Man.  \nThem: But outside of the things James, how you feeling?  \nMe: I'm doing pretty good. We got back home this week, which is actually just been nice. My wife and I readjusting, being back in our own space.  \nThem: Nice. Yeah. That's awesome.  \nMe: And then, like, just getting back ramped up and work and all that stuff. This week, it's been. It's been good. How are you guys doing?  \nThem: Okay? We're still working through the E. Filing right now. They're finally getting the filing going. So we're working through those nuances of rejects and the things that we want to work, but the biggest thing right now is just getting them moving. We need them to file more like keep filing.  \nMe: Yeah. Y. Eah.  \nThem: But overall, I mean, It's part of it. So it's nothing too overwhelming, but it's just working through what those nuances look like. And then also getting some of these templates created. From Pandadoc. I'm working through that list now. Yeah. I'm going to get those templates to them and just like, look, go ahead. And they've been closed this week as well. So that's another thing. It's just like,  \nMe: Oh, yeah, you said. You told me they were at. They have their off site or whatever, right?  \nThem: Yeah. Like in London somewhere.  \nMe: So they're completely out of pocket. Yeah. Not fun times in the middle of a big transformation. That's great customer service. Sorry.  \nThem: Yeah. No, you're fine. Because they even said. I James say this, right? He offered a lot. But I didn't really push this much this week because he kind of told me. We've been knowing this since, I guess, December, like, early. Like, since we've been on. He was like, well, look, this is a week. So they were saying, like, yeah, we can still do it. But I kind of use it, I guess, as my excuse to kind of focus on our internal processes and trying to get that together as well. But I James say they offer. They were like, look, we're out. But we can FlowBuilder some things happen. But that sort of thing. But no, I'm with you on that only.  \nMe: I think the offering is the important thing, at least. Right, like they were willing to FlowBuilder it work.  \nThem: Exactly.  \nMe: And, well, hopefully we don't end up taking ended up needing, like, the full, like, 45 minutes for this. But I wanted, I walked the extra time just in case. Like, since we're actually going to be working through stuff, I wanted to specifically, I think last time we got into a point where, like, okay, we have the curl requests coming in, but now we need. How do we actually, like, basically send a request from the initial system that we were working. Is that right?  \nThem: Okay? Right. That's true, yes.  \nMe: Were you able to get logged in? I remember last time, like, we. We got cut off, like, right as sort of. You were trying to get, like, access to that system.  \nThem: I'm trying to remember which one was giving us the issue. Get logged back in. Here. All the people are here that I might need access from which one was given the issue, do you remember? In the process.  \nMe: Can you open up your AutomateFlow account? We can look at the automation specifically because like we had it was the system that shares the the information about the lead.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: So do we have Incomplete, I think. Oh, I think it is this. I think it's the edited 11 days ago. That one at the top there. Yeah, that. Yep.  \nThem: This one, okay?  \nMe: Yep. Okay. Yeah. So it's in this. It's in the first. This catch, hook step that we were looking at. We need to say, where can we get the data? Like, Get the data to FlowBuilder the post request. To this hook.  \nThem: Trying to think.  \nMe: And if you go to a test real quick, it shows like the data we on the top, right? Sorry. So this is like. These are the examples of, like, the data that we pushed through. Again, these are just illustrative. You can kind of push through whatever. But I think the step we were on was like, okay, where is, like, the real place that this information would come from?  \nThem: Of trying to remember look on my face. It's like, I wonder what else where I needed it to come from because. I have a meeting. Our meetings have been kind of getting pushed just because. The file production has been kind of low. And we had a meeting, actually, with the guy on the Sunday afterward. The day later. Like that same Sunday. We met later that day. But I end up not making the meeting to get some of these questions answered. We've been trying to reschedule all week, but I think they got pushed. Trying to think if there's any. Let me think if there was something I can look at to actually see.  \nMe: I mean, honestly, if you guys need more time on this, do you want to maybe chat Tuesday to have a chance to, like, take a look at this and then we can come back? When you've had a chance to get with her back from him. If that is, I don't. I don't, like, totally happy to, like, work through, but if, like, if you don't have the inputs, then, like, you know, we can just touch base.  \nThem: I can. And that was the other thing.  \nMe: App.  \nThem: I'd hope the last few days, like. Yeah, let me really kind of corral some things that we could talk about. But every day there's been a fire. They've been got. They've, you know, we've just had some outstanding accounting issues and some of those things that we've worked through. I'm just trying to think if there is something that I would want. To discuss right now. And not that I'm feeling forced, but just since I do have your time.  \nMe: I mean, one thing that is on my list that we could just run through is, like, I don't think we've had actually a chance to talk about sort of the ROI on this yet. Like, how are we thinking about, like, the value proposition? At least, like, to preview that to you and just honestly, like, my kind of hope is, like, you look at me and be like, oh, this number doesn't FlowBuilder sense because X reason that we have, you know. With the goal being. Hey, how do. We for, like, you know, the two owners. How do we FlowBuilder the case that, like, the investment to move up this curve. Actually, like, James return value versus just like, oh, we did a bunch of stuff and we. We don't know what happened.  \nThem: That's good.  \nMe: So the first estimate, this is like the panda doc. And the way these calculation works, it's assuming a 40 hour week and then. Wait, where's. I'm 52e. Not E2. 60 times 12 times 40. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, it's assuming 40. Double check this because. Usually 12 months. Oh, yeah. $40 per hour. Sorry. This piece here. $40 per hour on average labor cost. I think that's one major assumption. The other major assumption is just like, how much time is this actually saving? Sort of like this 60 hours estimate is kind of across the entire team that we're imagining for all of the lawyers that are working there for some of this. Like, demand letter automation. I know we have, like, people today who are, like, not only writing all of these letters, printing them, having to go back to evaluate them. And then the other one that I think is, like, actually worth figuring out is, like, on this filing deadline tracker. So this is the world. I'm like, hey, like, maybe we need one fewer person to actually check this going forward. So instead of having, like, a headcount there, that person then is spending time on some of these things that drive value for us. As a business. I'll pause. Does this at least, like, structurally seem to FlowBuilder sense? I know. Obviously there's, like, lots of debate you could have on, like, what is the right amount of time.  \nThem: Right? Right.  \nMe: Do you think we could. Like, this would be something we could have a conversation with with, like, Tricia or maybe more of, like, even one of the lawyers, potentially, of, like, how much does this stuff actually take you? To do.  \nThem: No, I definitely think that would be a value add, and I think the structure has definitely headed down the right direction because. It's. It's. It's a good snapshot of, like, what. What. Where we are, what we're doing. Yeah, No, I think you encapsulated a good bit of where what we're doing right now, because even, even, like with Alexis Nexus scrubs that we spoke about, you know, we've been talking with them about different ways to even.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: Batch that process. So having an automation that could batch that for us. That would even be huge. We have a meeting with them on Tuesday that.  \nMe: Okay? What I might encourage. No pressure on this, but if you're like, as you're talking to different vendors, I might actually, like, use this to talk to them about, like, hey, this is how we're thinking about, like, the return that you guys were driving. Because what is what I. What I think there is important. To keep in mind for, like, you and Trisha is like, because you're working across so many different vendors, like, each of us are thinking about, like, our returns, basically, right? Like this, this is, this is assuming all of this value basically comes from AutomateFlow, which probably isn't true. Right. In practice. And so it may be helpful to be like, okay. If, if we're, like, doing all of these systems, if you think about, like, the estimated value or what your cost is that you're comparing this against, it would be the cost of, like, all of these systems together, not just, like, one of them individually. So that's just like, one thought to, like, seed. I want to plant that, I think would be helpful if you guys are continuing to have these conversations.  \nThem: No, that's. I think that's great. Because even if this is not the core, this is what makes it. This is what automates it. All right? And that's. That's what we're driving towards. Because even now, in Panda Doc, as we're moving things along, You know, just hearing the pain points of the staff as they're in it. Having an automation to where it can go from. CLS to system that we're using. The codes that are there, whatever is triggering. To actually pull it, push it over directly to Pandadoc, would be huge. Because right now, what they're having, the steps they're having to do. The information they're having to collate, the way they're having a position, signatures, those sorts of things. It really causes. A heavy lift.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know?  \nMe: Like, onboarding, like, they're all the changes that they have to go through, the mental model shift that they need to have.  \nThem: Exactly. And I think it's, it's really starting to play a take its toll sometimes not because they know it's, it's short term, but if I can FlowBuilder that term shorter than not, then, you know, that would help. So, you know, I think you're, you're thought process about it. Is really spot on.  \nMe: Awesome.  \nThem: Because you're covering the basis of where where we're. Where we're currently doing. Even to the point of, like you said, taking that file once they're done in Pandadoc. It's automatically moving it. Right now. There's a process where they happen to move it from Q to Q from person to person. Whereas we can use, we can utilize the flow and Panda Doc and then that final output would be get picked up by AutomateFlow and it would just be dropped in, you know, SFTP site for them to pick up and it just goes, you know, so it keeps it flowing. So no, I think your, your thought is right on. Like, you know, like you said, whether it's. If you're just a connector, it's a very important piece of it, so you're fine.  \nMe: Y. Es. Yep, that makes sense. So what I. What I James do super tactically, I James send a follow up, maybe let's say Tuesday, I guess. Because I know you've been trying to get the time this week, and there's been, like, fires involved. Yeah, let's say. Let's say Tuesday for now, and then we'll touch base, like, Monday afternoon to see if you've heard back from them, whether or not you have. And then we. Can, like, be flexible there.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: And then the other thing I want to, like, start asking about, my initial thought is this probably is like a mid to late February thing. But I think it could be worth putting getting some of this in front of the owners of like, hey, this is. These are the automations we're building towards. This is sort of like what the future of, like how we're envisioning this process and with an eye towards like, this protects your legacy, this helps you be successful, continue to build this out, because we don't want to get to the a spot where it's like, okay, you and I are all buttoned up. Trisha's aligned. And then. And then at the end, they're like, we don't. We don't believe it. They're. Like, oh, you know, it only takes. It only takes someone 10 hours to do this if they really know how to do their job. You know what I mean? Like, I could see, like, that kind of stuff happening. And, sure, they're, like, bought into the context.  \nThem: No, that's valid. And I James say that this iteration because we went through this with a little bit with Pandadoc. Right. But once we got got to the brass tacks of everything that was going on,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: They know the pain points. So if it addresses those pain points, And it makes sense and it streamlines and it automates and it keeps from someone, from. Tangibly having to be, oh, this is Dustin's role, or this is somebody else's role to where it's. It's running where the Dustin's on vacation or not. And it gets done, then that's. That's perfect. But no, I would love to. I think one of the biggest things that. I think that for a meeting like that, definitely showing them what we can, like, you know, how it would address our pain points, but maybe, I don't know, sometimes I wonder if it's. It's just me being the, you know, the tech side of me, but.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Showing people what it can do, especially on that. On that level, just because.  \nMe: Hardly possible because they probably don't even have the context of like. Yeah, no, that makes sense. We see that a lot where people are like, oh, AutomateFlow. Like, they have in their head. It's like, oh, you know, maybe if I have something in CRMPlatform, send me a TeamChat. And that's like, the extent of what they imagine. And for us to be like, oh, no, we're going to, like, transform the way that your lawyers, like, process these and how what your business sees.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: For them to even believe that's possible. Take some. Take some work. That makes sense.  \nThem: Right. So I think that type of call and that could happen at an earlier stage, and then you can get the feedback from them that we can also go back to, come back here and incorporate and say, like, hey, Well, these are the priorities. We're hearing from them, and then they've been. They've had exposure. They know where we're headed. They know what's going on. And that would also be helpful for me as well. I don't know if Tuesday's too soon, but we have, like, a manager's meeting on Tuesdays, right? To where we can show them.  \nMe: You guys, I can do Tuesday. What time is that managers meeting? Like, if we assume I'm, like, just dialing into that.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Let me see. That James be Tuesday at 2:00pm.  \nMe: 2:00pm I can do that. It does show a conflict. I'll move. I'll move this around and I'll plan and like again, check with your team to FlowBuilder sure that like works. There's not like other topics, but I'll plan to be available to like do sort of a hey, this is, like, been our partnership together so far. This is what, like, Charles, Trish and I have been working on. This is what we're working towards. This is what AutomateFlow is, just at a basic level.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Do you have questions? Kind of like. Just like the intro. This is what we're thinking about. Type conversation.  \nThem: No, definitely. And then even if you want to add in some of those pieces to show, like, these are some other things that we can incorporate into the system to do. I think this would be a great way to do so, and it might give you an opportunity, maybe hear some of our pain points as well.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And maybe speak to those, because there are like every department has. Heavy lifts that they're manually doing right now. Only because. That's just the way that it has to be done.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So if there's a way for you to automate that type of process or streamline it, I think that that opens up the door from going forward from there. Not to just continue to have the conversation between you and I about pandadot, but also we can start having the meetings with the individual managers themselves. Like we can have a call with this manager to where you can hear from their perspective. What the heavy lifts are and what AutomateFlow can automate. And at that point, it gives you a grand scheme of, okay, now I have the ecosystem of what's taking place, and you can break down, like, different phases or different pricing points or whatever that might look like. And that, I think that's where you'll get all of the buy in that you're looking for because it's there. Like they, the, the team wants more tech as long as it's going to help their day. Because their day right now, if they lose a person or if we get on onboarding of new clients or, you know, all of the things, like, you know, I'm sending these calls, and it's just like some files aren't formatted properly to where in my mind. It's like AutomateFlow could really pull from these data sources.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: Properly format according to the client's requirements and then give them what they need in a timely fashion. And it's. And it's, you know, it's not somebody doing. Exactly. And then we can fix it. So that's kind of what my thought is, is if we go down that path of Tuesday, or two, even if your meeting doesn't finish until like 2:15 or something, I can schedule then like, you know, so we can cover what our topics and not bring you in or if you want to come in and then we discuss after whatever that looks like. Right. But I really think that that would be a really great value add so that you can get the feedback that you would need, so you can, you can really hear, like, these are the pain points. And then we start getting on the calendars of the various managers, whether it's for 30, 45 minutes.  \nMe: Yeah, I just run.  \nThem: You and I and that manager get on a call. Let them. I don't say event session, but hey, what's going on? And I'll have a conversation with them beforehand so maybe I can gather some requirements or those sorts of things to where when you come to the call, you're already ready to address some of the issues that you've heard. Of, and then, you know, take away whatever we discuss in that call and then continue. Because at that point, I feel like that gives us a rolling schedule of this is what we're talking about. Like, it gives us kind of like a pecking order of what we're doing. So that works for you.  \nMe: And I like that, too, because, like, particularly if we're talking, like, broader transformations, it's like it's not just one team that they need alignment from. It's like whoever runs HR needs to agree. If there's an operations person. Finance. Well, I guess finances. Trisha, she's bought it.  \nThem: Yeah, no, I get what you mean, because it is, it's, it's like we, our main departments, you know, I feel like each one of them can, can benefit from these automations that would really take something off of their plate. And they don't have to train a new person. They don't have to do the things we're going to train the software, we're going to get it there. So, and, and I mean, ultimately the sign, the sign off would come from the two owners. And, you know, but having the teams understand why it would be a benefit. Gives them the opportunity to really speak their piece and say that these are just my pain points, period, with what's going on, and let's move that forward.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Another important, just sort of like, psychological safety piece is like, proving that another piece of technology is going to FlowBuilder their life harder. Because, like, I, for a lot of companies are like, just a lot of implementations is general. It's like, oh, you have a new piece of technology now that's just like, more stuff that you're asking me to do. Ideally, with AutomateFlow, you never even look at it. Like, it just. It just pulls stuff away and it's not, like, right and so. But, yeah, no, I think we're on the same page.  \nThem: That's it. Yeah. That's good.  \nMe: So actually if it's not on reason, why like 2:15 on the would be great. I can plan to like I'll send the counter hold and like plan to have a zoom or you can send me a zoom that I can plan to jump in on that time frame. And then. And then. Yeah. And then from there, like, we could be, like, okay, two owners. Does it FlowBuilder sense for us to go have conversations with your. With your, like, team leads here around, like, what options are there? Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. So it'll probably be, like, 10 people in the room. Like I said, literally the lead from every department.  \nMe: Oh, okay.  \nThem: Being that. Yep.  \nMe: Well, these James all be there. Like, that's okay. That's super. That makes it super helpful.  \nThem: Yeah, so. And then that point, like I said, you can. You can give that. You know, give the understanding when you have that conversation, maybe, you know, if you can prepare something of what, what it might be able to do or maybe what you've done for other, for other legal clients or because you have a fairly good understanding, I'll send you a couple recordings as well. I don't. Know if you. If. If you're okay.  \nMe: Absolutely. Now, you see, I was going to say is what I like super tactically today, today, Monday, sort of put together. Like this is like what I plan to present. I'll share that with you just to like, get your reactions.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: As well, and then I don't know if it makes sense.  \nThem: I just want to prep you.  \nMe: And then this is like, for. Let me know if this makes sense. For Tuesday or for something we should do later. We have basically like our internal in house counsel. We'll often, like, talk to, like, law firms about, like, hey, this is the type of legal stuff we do. I'm happy to bring him to this conversation if that would like. I think could be a good option. If that would FlowBuilder sense.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, if there is someone that can speak to speak their language for sure, I think that would be good. Like I said, you can put it together, but. Yeah, yeah.  \nMe: Let me confirm that he can join. I James definitely, like, well, I'm going to be putting together, like, the list of, like, here's what's there. But I think it is, like, helpful to, like, hear it from someone who lives your life. Right. Like, I'm clearly a salesperson, but his day job is to be a lawyer. So it's like.  \nThem: He knows the proceedings of the pleadings, the suits, the. The packets, the. You know, he. Yeah, I get. Yeah, yeah.  \nMe: Exactly. Okay, sounds great. Awesome. I hope you have a great weekend. Hope. I guess the only like action item I would have for you beyond just like giving me feedback on the presentations if you from the person who sends those who like, how would you get the API call to that webhook I think is like the big open question.  \nThem: Yep, I got you. I'll work on that. And then, like I said, anything beyond that, we'll just go back and forth so we can kind of help. Sharp. Sharp tune Sharpen fine tune Sharpen fine tune Find some packet for Tuesday.  \nMe: Awesome. Sounds good.  \nThem: Sounds good. All right.  \nMe: We can talk to you later.  \nThem: All right, man. You too. Bye. Bye.  \nMe: Bye. ",

Okay. Sorry. Yeah, it's assuming 40. Double check this because. Usually 12 months. Oh, yeah. $40 per hour. Sorry. This piece here. $40 per hour on average labor cost. I think that's one major assumption. The other major assumption is just like, how much time is this actually saving? Sort of like this 60 hours estimate is kind of across the entire team that we're imagining for all of the lawyers that are working there for some of this. Like, demand letter automation. I know we have, like, people today who are, like, not only writing all of these letters, printing them, having to go back to evaluate them. And then the other one that I think is, like, actually worth figuring out is, like, on this filing deadline tracker. So this is the world. I'm like, hey, like, maybe we need one fewer person to actually check this going forward. So instead of having, like, a headcount there, that person then is spending time on some of these things that drive value for us. As a business. I'll pause.

To keep in mind for, like, you and Trisha is like, because you're working across so many different vendors, like, each of us are thinking about, like, our returns, basically, right? Like this, this is, this is assuming all of this value basically comes from AutomateFlow, which probably isn't true. Right. In practice. And so it may be helpful to be like, okay. If, if we're, like, doing all of these systems, if you think about, like, the estimated value or what your cost is that you're comparing this against, it would be the cost of, like, all of these systems together, not just, like, one of them individually.

CLS to system that we're using. The codes that are there, whatever is triggering. To actually pull it, push it over directly to Pandadoc, would be huge.

But no, I would love to. I think one of the biggest things that. I think that for a meeting like that, definitely showing them what we can, like, you know, how it would address our pain points, but maybe, I don't know, sometimes I wonder if it's. It's just me being the, you know, the tech side of me, but."

Like, they have in their head. It's like, oh, you know, maybe if I have something in CRMPlatform, send me a TeamChat. And that's like, the extent of what they imagine. And for us to be like, oh, no, we're going to, like, transform the way that your lawyers, like, process these and how what your business sees."

We're hearing from them, and then they've been. They've had exposure. They know where we're headed. They know what's going on. And that would also be helpful for me as well. I don't know if Tuesday's too soon, but we have, like, a manager's meeting on Tuesdays, right? To where we can show them."

There's not like other topics, but I'll plan to be available to like do sort of a hey, this is, like, been our partnership together so far. This is what, like, Charles, Trish and I have been working on. This is what we're working towards. This is what AutomateFlow is, just at a basic level."

          "text": "So if there's a way for you to automate that type of process or streamline it, I think that that opens up the door from going forward from there. Not to just continue to have the conversation between you and I about pandadot, but also we can start having the meetings with the individual managers themselves. Like we can have a call with this manager to where you can hear from their perspective. What the heavy lifts are and what AutomateFlow can automate. And at that point, it gives you a grand scheme of, okay, now I have the ecosystem of what's taking place, and you can break down, like, different phases or different pricing points or whatever that might look like. And that, I think that's where you'll get all of the buy in that you're looking for because it's there. Like they, the, the team wants more tech as long as it's going to help their day. Because their day right now, if they lose a person or if we get on onboarding of new clients or, you know, all of the things, like, you know, I'm sending these calls, and it's just like some files aren't formatted properly to where in my mind. It's like AutomateFlow could really pull from these data sources."

And then we can fix it. So that's kind of what my thought is, is if we go down that path of Tuesday, or two, even if your meeting doesn't finish until like 2:15 or something, I can schedule then like, you know, so we can cover what our topics and not bring you in or if you want to come in and then we discuss after whatever that looks like. Right. But I really think that that would be a really great value add so that you can get the feedback that you would need, so you can, you can really hear, like, these are the pain points. And then we start getting on the calendars of the various managers, whether it's for 30, 45 minutes."

And I'll have a conversation with them beforehand so maybe I can gather some requirements or those sorts of things to where when you come to the call, you're already ready to address some of the issues that you've heard. Of, and then, you know, take away whatever we discuss in that call and then continue. Because at that point, I feel like that gives us a rolling schedule of this is what we're talking about. Like, it gives us kind of like a pecking order of what we're doing. So that works for you."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "And I like that, too, because, like, particularly if we're talking, like, broader transformations, it's like it's not just one team that they need alignment from. It's like whoever runs HR needs to agree. If there's an operations person. Finance. Well, I guess finances. Trisha, she's bought it."

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah, no, I get what you mean, because it is, it's, it's like we, our main departments, you know, I feel like each one of them can, can benefit from these automations that would really take something off of their plate. And they don't have to train a new person. They don't have to do the things we're going to train the software, we're going to get it there. So, and, and I mean, ultimately the sign, the sign off would come from the two owners. And, you know, but having the teams understand why it would be a benefit. Gives them the opportunity to really speak their piece and say that these are just my pain points, period, with what's going on, and let's move that forward."

          "speaker": "me",

Because, like, I, for a lot of companies are like, just a lot of implementations is general. It's like, oh, you have a new piece of technology now that's just like, more stuff that you're asking me to do. Ideally, with AutomateFlow, you never even look at it. Like, it just. It just pulls stuff away and it's not, like, right and so. But, yeah, no, I think we're on the same page."

I can plan to like I'll send the counter hold and like plan to have a zoom or you can send me a zoom that I can plan to jump in on that time frame. And then. And then. Yeah. And then from there, like, we could be, like, okay, two owners. Does it FlowBuilder sense for us to go have conversations with your. With your, like, team leads here around, like, what options are there? Okay."

You know, give the understanding when you have that conversation, maybe, you know, if you can prepare something of what, what it might be able to do or maybe what you've done for other, for other legal clients or because you have a fairly good understanding, I'll send you a couple recordings as well.

How are you doing?  \nThem: Hi. How are you? Can you hear me?  \nMe: Yes, I can.  \nThem: I'm using a different headset than usual, so.  \nMe: Work. Did you have a good holiday season? Not over yet. Still have New Years to go. But you have a good Christmas? I guess it really wouldn't ask me.  \nThem: It was. It was pretty good. I'm actually out of town right now, so I'm taking this on the road, which is why I'm using a different headset. Where do. Where are you from?  \nMe: I am based out of a gust well currently in Augusta, Georgia. Which is where I'm from, where my family is. But I'm like, based out of Austin, Texas is sort of where I live currently, which is why I took a second to.  \nThem: Yeah. I'm based in Louisiana, but I am currently. I'm currently up north, and it is very slushy right now. So we stayed in for the day because we flew in the New York and now we're in. New hampshire.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We're in the. On that line between New Hampshire and Vermont, so, like, it's hard to tell, like, which side you're on.  \nMe: Definitely nice.  \nThem: And so I think I'm in new hampshire.  \nMe: You have family up there? You guys like doing skiing or what took you up north?  \nThem: Well, so. So I have a split family, sort of. Right now I live in Louisiana. My husband is currently working for Dartmouth.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And so my son. Hadn't seen him in a while. Yeah. And so here we are. And we do this trip probably twice a year. Either we all meet somewhere.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Are we? Like, back and forth, so. We actually met in Orlando and in Vegas already this year, and now we're up here.  \nMe: That's cool. Did you guys do when you were Orlando? Did you do, like, the Disney World universal stuff?  \nThem: We did, so I used to work there. A very, very long time ago, like more than two or three decades ago. And the epic universe was just opening. I actually opened Islands of Adventure park and. And like, their secondary park when I was there. And I worked at Disney too, but so that thought that another park was opening and I wouldn't be there was kind of like, So we went, like, a week into the opening, we let them iron out a few kinks.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: Not a. Not a lot, but a few.  \nMe: Eah. Yeah, my wife and I, actually, we went the first week of December. We were in Orlando, did the whole Universal Parks thing. It was her first time going to any of the parks. And of course, I had not been to Epic Universe before. I thought I. Honestly, it was really cool. I had a really good time, like the super. Mario world was the ton of. Was a ton of fun. I'm the stereotypical millennial. And like, the Harry Potter world was like a great time also. It was just all around, like. Actually, I was really, really impressed with the whole thing.  \nThem: Well, so we did. So that was the second time we did it. We actually did it twice, me and Cameron and. Let me tell you. The. The second time we. We bought wands, watches. Like the whole nine. We were all over the place. It was crazy. But it's amazing how they can pull off some of the things that they pull off.  \nMe: It really is. And especially, like, I didn't even realize, like, you were talking about the watches, like, the Mario world. I was like, I'm a grown man, and I'm like, I want to.  \nThem: We did. We hit everyone, every. Everything that they had. And I'm like, you know, the next time we come, we're going to have to pack all this crap. Back.  \nMe: Is Charles still going to be able to join us?  \nThem: Yes. Let me message him. We had. We had a tough or they had a tough morning. I say.  \nMe: Yeah. You mentioned there were some product issues going on.  \nThem: Oh, he's still on with Panda Dog, so he has a meeting that's running over. So he James be here. It's just taking a moment.  \nMe: No worries. I'm 100% okay to wait, but it wouldn't be better to, like, meet tomorrow morning? Like, when you've had a chance to get this resolved or, like. Or can you. Or should you and I maybe jump in? Would that be.  \nThem: Well, so I. He. He kind of scheduled this, like, on the fly.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And so I know what we're talking about, but I don't have the specifics. So let me see how far he is in.  \nMe: No worries.  \nThem: We? Yeah, we had. One of our. Three of our computers went down today.  \nMe: That is not fun. Or, like, some of your lawyers, like, back in, like, already working again.  \nThem: Yeah, it's kind of crazy because we're fighting this huge deadline. So Louisiana. Went all efile as of January 1st. So I can fill you in on this. He said he does want to reschedule for tomorrow morning, but at least I can fill you in on, like, what's happening and what's driving us here.  \nMe: For sure.  \nThem: So L.A. made this huge push about 10 years ago to go full efile, but they kept pushing the law back, and so people were just sort of like, oh, okay, well, this is never going to happen, right?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: October, mid October this year, we got a call from one of the clerk of courts who's like, hey. You're the largest filer in the state, can you be our beta tester? And we're like, beta tester for what? And they're like, oh, you didn't know? The law's going forward this year. And so we literally get the notice.  \nMe: And like you. God. Sorry. Keep going, keep going.  \nThem: But it wasn't just us. It wasn't just us. Like, none of the firms. So we're the largest filer in the state, but we're the largest collection firm, period. There's nobody who even comes close to the. The volume.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay?  \nThem: So what I realized was okay. We're full paper right now. We cannot be full paper in three months because we James. Other law firms are taking like a quarter of what we do, and they. Print, sign, rescan. File, it comes back, they print, notarize, fine. Scan, and I'm like, We file like. Roughly 300 suits a day. We would never. We would never keep up. So we developed. An E review solution. And just a couple of months. And that's the call that he stuck on right now is Pandadoc. Panda, Doc, is who we're using. And what we realized is so for the first, we'll be ready. But we won't be 100% ready because we need that API between CLS, who is our source of truth, and PandaDoc, where every all the information is going into.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And so that's where you come in.  \nMe: That does FlowBuilder sense. Okay. And. Sorry, I know, I know when. I'll probably get more details on this from Charles tomorrow morning. But are you guys envisioning. Is it like, Charles, someone on your team, like, hands on keyboards, doing this building? Are you envisioning, like, AutomateFlow people, like, doing these connections for. You or, like, how are you thinking about that?  \nThem: So I'm not really sure. So I hired Charles because he. He's. He's a developer, and. But it's just him and I on that side. And we've been doing some serious heavy lifting for PandaDoc. Now we have PandaDoc off the ground. We just about got everything built for everybody to start testing, which really sucks because we're, like, in the last few days and everybody's. Off like, you know, back and forth between Christmas and New Year's. But we have it where it's just about ready. We just have to upload a spreadsheet. Currently, instead of our system talking, our system is talking.  \nMe: Okay? So it's like there's like, kind of like one step that's needed, at least initially. I think that's honestly probably something like 80% of AutomateFlow usage is like, hey, we have this one thing where you need to get this system to this other system, and that is typically very, very straightforward, and especially if he's already developer, almost certainly James not be a problem for him to like FlowBuilder that connection. We definitely do have like lots of resources available and like support around that, but my initial reaction based off of his background is it's probably not needed. Okay, that's helpful. I James reschedule this for tomorrow with Charles, but this actually, this at least helps me get a sense of, like, what direction we're. We're trying to do. And I think the main thing, I'll paint this in an email that would be helpful to see if have him come with some of just, like, the technical details. Around the connection because I think that's going to be the limiting factor of, like, the we have a Panda doc integration, but how that connects to your current system, how he's imagining, like, making that API connection, all that kind of jazz James help us get him quickly on this because it sounds and super, I think. This should be doable in the timeframe that you guys are looking at. But, of course, leaning this quick,  \nThem: Well, so we're actually. This is Phase One. We knew there was going to be a Phase Two that's going to be part of Phase Two. So it may be that that Verdacan who is our Cls support. Panda, Doc and Charles and I meet with you in like all kind of come to minds. About it.  \nMe: Yeah. Absolutely. If we. We do a bunch of working work with a lot of different vendors around, like, how can AutomateFlow help sort of sit in the middle of these different systems?  \nThem: We've used you before. Which is why we reached out to you. Yeah.  \nMe: That, don't. O. H. Actually, I don't. I don't think I knew that. I don't think we had. Or at least maybe not. Maybe in the past, but we didn't currently have. Have like a. Have a license for you guys, okay? Cool. That's good to know. So there's at least a little bit of experience with it, which I think should FlowBuilder FlowBuilder this a lot easier, too. Okay, that's awesome. Okay?  \nThem: I'm sorry, though, for, like, you know, the Pand.  \nMe: Trust me. I've worked in IT before. I did professional services for a while. I've been there more time a hundred times over there. Could you take a look at his calendar tomorrow morning? Would like noon central work for you guys?  \nThem: Emic.  \nMe: Or actually, I could. I could do 10am or noon or two types of movies I have right now.  \nThem: Okay? We started working, like, at 3:00am this morning because we had a message from our thing saying, hey, we can't. We can't log on. And I'm like, And I'm not at the office, so I had to have him go to the office and tell him, like, where everything was and fun stuff.  \nMe: Here, near the scale. I've done. I've done a couple of my own startups here and there where you're like the only person when you're like the person who the buck stops your on call kind of no matter what is going on. I have been there.  \nThem: So. I'm the cfo, and he's. I hired him because I was like, I can't. I don't have time to, like, develop this by myself. There's no way.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I can imagine.  \nThem: He hasn't responded. Let me get him to email you real quick.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: I'm a hop on the panda doc and see what's going on over there.  \nMe: What I James do for now is I'll send it for the noontime and then if we need to, if we need to move it around just to FlowBuilder sure we like, don't lose the window for now and then we'll chat tomorrow on the details. Good luck. Trisha. Great to meet. And we'll talk more tomorrow.  \nThem: Thank you. You have a good day.  \nMe: Bye.  \nThem: Bye. Bye. ",

We would never. We would never keep up. So we developed. An E review solution. And just a couple of months. And that's the call that he stuck on right now is Pandadoc. Panda, Doc, is who we're using. And what we realized is so for the first, we'll be ready.

And we've been doing some serious heavy lifting for PandaDoc. Now we have PandaDoc off the ground. We just about got everything built for everybody to start testing, which really sucks because we're, like, in the last few days and everybody's. Off like, you know, back and forth between Christmas and New Year's. But we have it where it's just about ready. We just have to upload a spreadsheet. Currently, instead of our system talking, our system is talking."

          "text": "Okay? So it's like there's like, kind of like one step that's needed, at least initially. I think that's honestly probably something like 80% of AutomateFlow usage is like, hey, we have this one thing where you need to get this system to this other system, and that is typically very, very straightforward, and especially if he's already developer, almost certainly James not be a problem for him to like FlowBuilder that connection. We definitely do have like lots of resources available and like support around that, but my initial reaction based off of his background is it's probably not needed. Okay, that's helpful. I James reschedule this for tomorrow with Charles, but this actually, this at least helps me get a sense of, like, what direction we're. We're trying to do. And I think the main thing, I'll paint this in an email that would be helpful to see if have him come with some of just, like, the technical details. Around the connection because I think that's going to be the limiting factor of, like, the we have a Panda doc integration, but how that connects to your current system, how he's imagining, like, making that API connection, all that kind of jazz James help us get him quickly on this because it sounds and super, I think. This should be doable in the timeframe that you guys are looking at. But, of course, leaning this quick,"

Give me one second. We just start our e filing process. So it is. No, I'm more.  \nMe: I can hear you. I agree.  \nThem: We just start our e filing process, so. It. Comes with a couple new set of challenges, to say the least.  \nMe: Yeah. How'd that go? Because that started literally five days ago, right? Like when they started sitting those over Jan1.  \nThem: It did. Hold on one second. I'm trying to see. So. Rry. I just want to FlowBuilder sure that we. Have someone. That they asked for a update. Okay, perfect. Got it. I just want to try to get them a communication so they can keep moving while we're moving.  \nMe: Yeah, absolutely.  \nThem: No. So we're working through what that process looks like right now. What we decided to do was, I think, kind of what we discussed. Was. Moving PDF. So we moved the PDF into the file.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then until we worked through the template. So we're going to. I'm going to start working through what the templates need to be so we can properly use PandaDoc. But right now, We are dropping a PDF in and then getting signatures. So once we're capturing all the E signatures, we collate that final product and then we drop it off to another team that's actually going to file the paperwork. With the courts.  \nMe: Clarify question. When you say you, like, collate those, I assume that's like someone going into Panda Doc and downloading and combining those, or is that done automatically right now?  \nThem: It's not. No, it's cool. I appreciate the question because you're in the right direction, per usual, so I appreciate it. But no, right now it is a process of us dropping in the documents manually. Some of them come prepackaged with all of. So it's like the court documents. It might be the media and. Media meaning anything? I don't know if I explained it to you, but I'll definitely. So the media is. When we go to suit. It's anything that might be needed to prove our case.  \nMe: No, I totally.  \nThem: So whether it's if it's a car loan that defaulted, it might be the car loan paperwork with that person's signature, the copy of their license and any of the bills that went to the address and any previous payments. So at this point, it becomes a you can't deny this isn't your loan that didn't get paid because we have all the document that says it. It's you.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You did it. All of the things. So we combine that packet. And any of the other, if there's any other documents that we need to attach to it, and then that entire suit gets sent over to the court to file. But.  \nMe: I don't think we didn't talk about this part specifically last time. Could you talk to me a bit about, like, where does that information come from? So, like, let's say so, like, you get a docusign, like, and I'm. I'm one of your, like, evaluate, like, running your process. How do. Where do I, like, go to gather those data sources that you were just talking about, like, the media that's tied to that?  \nThem: Sure.  \nMe: Contract.  \nThem: So usually a media. It comes in. It's signed in by a document team. So we have a document team that does a lot of scanning, and they scan it into a software called Paper Vision. So. I'm sorry. Paper vision.  \nMe: What was that? Paper. What? Sorry. Paper vision, okay? Yeah.  \nThem: So we would. We would love to get it in a, you know, in a. In a different type of software, but right now, that's what we're kind of using. We're thinking through what that looks like. We're going through the documents as far as getting the right legal ramifications or the right legal structure, because the way that we operate is everything's really supposed to reside here in house. So it's hard for us to say that, you know, all of our legal. We can't expose any of our documents to a third party. So in order to do so, we have to kind of keep everything in house. So that's the one thing about paper vision. It's scanned, and it resides here in our local network and our local system. So the only thing about it that.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I'm still working through. Understanding is. One. If the, the documents are scanned, they're scanning with a certain name, filing or naming convention. And underneath that naming convention, sometimes some documents remain in the packet, some don't. So at that point it's, it's a. How. How would you automate it? If it is an automation, I feel like it. Could be, but just figuring out what that logic needs to be to say this documents get gets added. But then it also becomes an understanding of depending upon the type of filing, whether it's like a garnishment or, you know, a suit petition or just just the different types of filings determines where documents fall within the packet because they have to organize the pages in a certain, in a certain fashion. So that becomes pretty manual. Just to know this page goes before, before the court documents or goes within the core documents or which ones gets removed before it gets filed, you know, so those are, those are some of the manual touches on that packet. That is taking place right now. I don't know if that explained the question that you're asking. Okay, okay.  \nMe: That's actually helpful. No, that seems helpful. I guess. Honestly, my main question, I think, is, like, basically, like, just where would you want to start? Because I feel like there's, like, lots of places where you could, like, hey, like, there's a piece here that we could automate. There's a piece here. That we could automate of all of these. Like, what do you feel? Like is like, the. And I guess if we think of, like, impact versus effort, like an impact versus effort matrix, like, there's probably something that's, like, maybe medium impact, relatively low effort, and I'm thinking in specific context of like, hey, if we got, if we have you guys start a AutomateFlow trial, and that's a two week trial, and we can, we can end up extending if we need to. But, like, what's something that's like, realistic in two weeks that, like, even could be done in that time frame if that makes.  \nThem: Right. That's good. No, that's good. It does. It does. And I was kind of thinking about the same thing as I was kind of prepping for the meeting. So within our process, there's a couple of. There are a couple points that we are going to need to automate, but one of the things I'm working through PandaDoc with now is where we start our. So we're going through and templatizing. The, the documents that we're currently getting scanned in. So once those are made into templates, then we can properly pass that document on to team to team, we can track the document, that sort of a thing. But there's. There's. There's a need for Panda doc to get the information to plug into the templates, and if you want, I can kind of. Let me show you one.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: If that. If that'll work. See if I can. Let me pull one up and then. So I'm thinking this might be our first step, because on the back side, there is a necessity for. The documents to be passed off to the. To the person picking it up. But right now, we've kind of worked out a process to where they are. They're just going to pick it up from a shared folder because they're a team that we work with. So let me see if I can.  \nMe: I mean, I don't know if this is something you want to do. I think it'd be very straightforward. Just, like, send an email to, like, hey, we dropped something in the shared folder. That we have. Or something like that, I don't know.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Like, right now, we're just definitely just kind of. And the reason why I say that is because they have an API that'll pick it up and just start filing it. Right. So we won't even have to. What am I doing?  \nMe: Watch that. But that's probably, like, step two or three.  \nThem: Yeah. So that's. That's what I mean. Once we get the documents to where they're automated, then there's no human interaction with it at all. And I think that's kind of. That's our. That's our end goal.  \nMe: Right.  \nThem: Is is that sort of a thing. But to get there. Right? Now, what we're currently doing is what we call a word merge, right? So we're using. We're doing. We're. We're merging all of the field information. Through word. To create this type of document. So this. This is the. This is the under. Let me show you. Two different ones completed. So velo merge. All right, so. So this is what the formatted letter might look like. This is not complete. It's not complete, but it still gives you an understanding of. Okay, this is what it kind of would look like. We get the client plan.  \nMe: Yeah. And then on the other one, you know, where you have those, like, brackets as, like, we drop in. Exactly.  \nThem: There you go. So this might be because our goal is to have someone, someone in our staff to be able to use our. Our main. Our main software, the Kia code. Right now, they key a code and it kicks off. It kicks off into word merge and uses these fields. So what we've been doing is in Pandadoc. Is replicating this very document with the same merge field type of logic. And within that logic, then it should produce this this document fully completed. So what we're needing is a way to get that information from our software into Panda Doc to actually create this. So this might. This is. This James probably be our first. No, no, you're good. This. I think this would be our first. Our first hit.  \nMe: Okay? I. I think this is makes a ton of sense. And super tacky. Let me describe how I. How I imagined this flow going.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: So the first step, and I think this still, if I remember correctly, this still would require like a, like a web hook call on your end. Like, they put into the system, we FlowBuilder a web hook call and like, it includes and just confirming that, like, initial message, it James include like all of these fields. Right. Yeah, so we would. We would include those fields and then. I've not used Panda doc as much, but I'm not mistaken. There's like a generate. Actually, wait, let me not talk. Let me check. Check.  \nThem: No, you're fine because.  \nMe: I think there's, like, a generate contract. Action.  \nThem: You know, because I haven't looked into it as deep. I kind of had to kind of pull out, pull back, and just understand, like, okay, let me get them going. And then kind of like what we said, Right? So now. Now I'm able to kind of. We're going through the first iterations of okay? You know, break fixes on what's going on with the E file process, But I know there is. There is, you know? AutomateFlow is definitely one of the main, the main suggestions that we use for some of those automations. So I just don't know with automations too, as of yet, so.  \nMe: Yeah. No, that makes. That makes some sense.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Let me share my screen real quick.  \nThem: No, sure, go ahead.  \nMe: Place. Current share desk. Top. So just confirming. So I just did a quick was just looking at and this is our app integrations page. I included this in the last email sent. But like, if you're ever like, oh, as you're playing around with stuff like do they have an app? Like, what does the app include? Like that this is sort of that place to go. And so I think what we'd want is, like, this create document, and we would define the template.  \nThem: Perfect.  \nMe: And as we pass in the information here, like the template, the template James have the fields. That we. That we want to include. So we'll pass those from the first message to the template and actually, let me. Let's open up.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: A zap and see what this actually looks like. Webhooks. Just.  \nThem: And you were saying this is. These services are paid by the ZAP or it depends on what type of.  \nMe: It's paid by the number of API calls that you FlowBuilder. So in this case, the Web, like the webhook, would not count against you. But then you would say, okay, we're creating a document.  \nThem: Got it. Nice. Now we can step through it. That's fine. Yeah. If you want. Or do you have one already?  \nMe: I think. I think I have one that I can use at least to like.  \nThem: Okay? Cool.  \nMe: Show the step.  \nThem: You waking was okay.  \nMe: Yeah, actually. Very good. Well, okay, so.  \nThem: Nice.  \nMe: There is. A sorry. Come on. Look. Oh, okay. So panda. Okay, I can't do the panda doc thing at the moment. Can we maybe. Can we. Can we switch? Have you share? We can walk through. Cause I can't. It won't let me log in.  \nThem: Yeah. That's no problem. Go ahead.  \nMe: And actually, this is probably just good practice to, like, actually click around AutomateFlow.  \nThem: Definitely. Definitely. I think it'll be a good resource to reference as well. All right. Okay? Let me. Okay? Can you see this?  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: I tried to expand it, but I don't know if you can read it. Sorry.  \nMe: No, I totally can. Can you actually. Can you go into AutomateFlow? Because I want to. What I want to do is, like, actually FlowBuilder the. Create the connection and just kind of show you what that looks like directly.  \nThem: Did I? I don't know if I created an account just.  \nMe: Oh, we can do live. Start with a free one.  \nThem: Ironically. Okay?  \nMe: By default.  \nThem: I can try. What? I don't think I did. Maybe. Okay? Okay? Yeah, one day. The transactors pay features, okay?  \nMe: Okay? Great. So let's go to create in the top left. And then zap there.  \nThem: Oops. Right here.  \nMe: Yep. That's great. And then I would not worry about the copilot for now. For that first one, the trigger, let's click that and just FlowBuilder that a webhook.  \nThem: First one that you selected.  \nMe: Yep. That's right.  \nThem: Keyboard.  \nMe: And we can ignore that for now and then. Here we go. Let's go to the. Let's go to the action and FlowBuilder that Pandadoc. And then you should be able to actually. So for action event on the right hand side here in that box. So we want create document. And then you'll log in with the account there. Awesome. Cool. And then if you hit continue, the next step James, like, actually start to configure it. So the template, I think, is probably going to be important here. Depending on which template you're talking about.  \nThem: We can. There's one called Standard. Hold on, let me see. Track standard. This one. Okay?  \nMe: And then, so if you scroll down, you should see, like, here it has, like, the different fields that are in that template. And if you click into one of those, you'll be basically a little hard with the webhook, but you can. You'll effectively be able to pull variables from the webhook. And drop them in here.  \nThem: Nice. First need to set this up.  \nMe: Because, like, right. Right now, there's nothing coming out of the webhook to fill in, if that makes sense.  \nThem: It does. So. Catch the web pole. Catch Rahul.  \nMe: Probably the catch. The first one, catch hook.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: And then like, it'll be like a post request. So if you go to continue to the next one. It should. Actually, I don't think you need a child key there, so if you continue. And then test. So if you copy that URL. And maybe. Maybe you can do like a curl. Oh, no, no worries.  \nThem: Oops, sorry. Go ahead. What were you saying?  \nMe: Maybe, like, FlowBuilder, like, a curl request. Potentially with just like a first name, last name, I don't know, due date or something like that as, like a post that. URL in our chat.  \nThem: This one.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Okay? Where? Are we?  \nMe: Okay? One second. So. Let's hand it back. Document. Creation. It. Means. And, like, date or something like that. Just a starting point, and then this is the URL. Okay, cool. I'm asking Claude to give me a curl request that we could run against this. Like one. One second.  \nThem: But. Yeah. So I'm thinking, like, once we can. Once we get these templates. No, I was just saying this.  \nMe: Okay? Oh, sorry.  \nThem: Just the more I think about it, that this is really like the perfect start to get a. Get some good quick hits and move the progress for. Move the project forward as well.  \nMe: He tried test trigger. Now, there should be a post request that came through. Potentially. There we go. If we continue with that.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Record as the example.  \nThem: Continue here. This one or just hit Continue.  \nMe: If you want to click into it, you can see, like, what. What was included in the post. Right. So it's like it just has these fields as, like, An example.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Here.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: And then if we hit continue, those fields James then be available in the panda, doc. Action.  \nThem: So continue again.  \nMe: And then on this page, if you scroll down to, like, where it has, like, role, for example, or, like, if there's, like, a client name.  \nThem: This one here. So what? I type.  \nMe: I would do the plus, the plus sign.  \nThem: In. Because it actually. Oh, okay.  \nMe: Exactly.  \nThem: First name, so. If I know that, it would be. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. So put that.  \nMe: And just to be super clear, the post request can be can be whatever you want. I just included a couple fields here as like.  \nThem: So we can get going. Yeah. Got it. So then go to the next one, do the same.  \nMe: Yep. Yeah, exactly.  \nThem: Okay? First. Oh, email. Sorry. This would have been. Email.  \nMe: I mean, you actually want to delete that one. Oh. Back. Just do backspace. There we go.  \nThem: Okay? Name. Copy.  \nMe: Company.  \nThem: I don't think it has phone number.  \nMe: No phone number.  \nThem: So we just.  \nMe: Look like turning emails required. I guess use her email as just like the.  \nThem: The same one.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Just sent me an email, okay?  \nMe: Yeah. Just because it looks like that field is specifically required to create the template.  \nThem: Oh, because of the Aster. Got it.  \nMe: Any of these.  \nThem: Should I keep filling them all out or just.  \nMe: No, that should be. I think that should be fine. Like, if we scroll down, is anything else here required before.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: What else is required.  \nThem: It's pretty neat the way it's really pulling everything in. No, I don't see anything else.  \nMe: Wait. In the top, right. The. There's the little refresh thing. Click. That sometimes. It like doesn't always notice that you have all the required fields. Okay. Know what it's saying? Scroll up.  \nThem: In order to.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah.  \nThem: It would. I see what you're saying.  \nMe: One of the fields we need. Send document folder. Oh, document name. You need a document name. So, like. Yeah. There we go. There we go.  \nThem: Perfect, perfect. Perfect.  \nMe: Yep. And then if you test this step, it'll create the document in PandaDoc with these fields filled out.  \nThem: Interesting.  \nMe: Okay? So then we should see if we did. If we go back, if we go over to Pandadoc, we should be able to see. Like that newly created document. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  \nThem: This is it.  \nMe: And actually, I guess one tactical thing. It looks like we selected send it instead of just create the document. In the action. So we probably, like, you probably want those as two separate steps going forward. Where, like, you do one to create maybe at least for the first couple, where, like, you do one to create the document in, like, a separate that sends it. But it probably can be collapsed in, like, a medium term once we, like, have the good, clear process.  \nThem: Okay, okay. I see what you mean. So what? The percentage here is. Is that an indication of anything? That you know of.  \nMe: I that I'm not sure. I think maybe that's like screen. What is this percent of time?  \nThem: Probably completing the. It does. That's pretty good. So I wonder what email address it would go into, but.  \nMe: It's like the acne one. It's going to be sarah.acnecorp.com.  \nThem: It's interesting because it created the document, it submitted all of the field names that she had. And if we would have filled in the others, then it would have done those at the same time as well.  \nMe: Exactly.  \nThem: That's pretty cool. Because it did. It associated. And I know what this percentage is now. I'm sorry. So the percentage is the amount that she's actually completed.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: The percentage of the document is actually completed. Because, you know, I can. I can, can I?  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: Interest. Ing. So she's the sign. Or the document's been sent out. Okay, that's pretty cool. And it puts in where she would need to complete those values. And there's nothing for her to complete here but these checkboxes. Interesting. So let me see something by edit document. Wonder if I can just change it to me right quick. I wonder if that'll do anything. Well, I probably have to do that for each one. Let me see if I do.  \nMe: Oh, they're all going to be.  \nThem: Yeah. They're separate boxes. Let me see if I can control Z. I think I can multi select, but I don't know.  \nMe: I mean, do you want to just send. You want me to send another one with your email as the email?  \nThem: Yeah, let's try that. Let's try that. Another reason why I say it is just because at this point it allows me to.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: To do a little bit more with it, but that's pretty cool.  \nMe: One. Moment.  \nThem: You want me to give any information that you need.  \nMe: I just have to. I was going to pull up your email.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: From.  \nThem: From the email. I mean, from the ticket. Not ticket. But from our email correspondence.  \nMe: Exactly. And then there's also. Okay? Cool. That one. If so, I just sent another in. In, like, the AutomateFlow.  \nThem: Okay? Can we determine where goes folder wise?  \nMe: You're saying which folder the document goes in. I think so we go back to the action.  \nThem: Right. I got to go further along. But okay. And that's within AutomateFlow.  \nMe: Yeah. So configure here.  \nThem: Which one? This one. Double click.  \nMe: Engine on the right side, like the little window. That's on the right.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Yeah, and then we want to go back to configure.  \nThem: Got it. Okay?  \nMe: And actually, sorry, first you want to go to catch the webhook one because we want to change the test action that we're flowing through.  \nThem: Select folder.  \nMe: So we don't need anything. There. Hit. Continue. And then do find new records. Oh, wait. Did it not? Can you try? Try one more time. One second. Let me see.  \nThem: It change. Oh, no. Okay, I got you.  \nMe: I sent another one with a different recipient. Name. Maybe.  \nThem: Go back to setup and just kind of.  \nMe: A success.  \nThem: We found records in AutomateFlow web account. This rule below 3 most recent.  \nMe: Oh, wait. Wait, wait. Maybe click. There should be. At least. I'm sorry.  \nThem: Are you okay? It says we found records. We James load up to. Oh, no. I see what you're saying, it's just. Saying because we didn't have to type anything here, right?  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just the. It's just the one. And this second one should.  \nThem: Should I try to close in and go back into it?  \nMe: I wonder. Yeah, maybe try that. And then I'm also just trying one more time because I had a. I think I had an extra comment at the end of the thing.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Let's see if that. There we go.  \nThem: There we go.  \nMe: That did do it. So, yeah, this one. And I would continue with selected record here.  \nThem: Perfect.  \nMe: And so then now the test James send to that. Email. But then you would still. You still have to trigger the test run again on here and folder as an option. Which.  \nThem: And I see there's multiple folders that I can select from. That's pretty cool.  \nMe: And this is the kind of thing where, like, if you need different folders for these, like, you could pass that in as part of the request.  \nThem: Let me actually. That's good. Let's go back here. Wonder if I need to close it to pick up a move.  \nMe: Yeah. And you might have to run the refresh again to potentially, like, in the top, right?  \nThem: Okay? Oh, yeah. That's right. Awesome. Okay?  \nMe: And then also, you probably actually don't want to send, if I understand correctly. Or do we. Do we want to send?  \nThem: Ended up there.  \nMe: Immediately.  \nThem: Oh. Let's try. I'm interested to see what it does.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: The only reason why I say it is because ultimately what it would do is it sends to me and then it starts a chain of moving the document forward. So just hit continue.  \nMe: Yeah. Yep. If you continue and then retest step.  \nThem: Run, okay?  \nMe: And then let me also. I mean, just post while I'm. Before I forget, I'm going to paste in the curl requests that I was using. To FlowBuilder these. Post request.  \nThem: Nice. That's mine.  \nMe: But it didn't get added to the folder, it seemed.  \nThem: No, I think it did here.  \nMe: Oh, okay, okay, sorry.  \nThem: Let me go back and look documents. Sorry. Still. This is actually interesting because this wasn't even a trigger before. Like, this is what we want. We want to be able to see, like right now, what we're having to do, which is odd. I don't know. All documents created by me, so it's here.  \nMe: Oh, there we go. Okay, cool it. Did it.  \nThem: And there's document. Perfect.  \nMe: Did.  \nThem: What I want to do is move that one that wasn't in a folder to that folder. We go. Try to keep it clean for them.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: All right. No, that's pretty cool. So right now, what we're doing is within these, within these, the folder structures, we're not able to actually have anything. We're not. What? We're not able to have anything. Passed along, like so they're having a checkup folder, right? But the ult, the ultimate goal is for them to come in and say,  \nMe: Like, see this?  \nThem: Exactly. This is what you have to do. This is you have to complete. This is why you need an action, that sort of a thing.  \nMe: Yeah. And I think this works really well, too, because, like, if you saw there's a there, I assume that's tied to the lawyer. Email in there. So it'll be tied to, like, their Panda Doc accounts. Theoretically. And that might. Might be, like, a good, specific thing to test as you're working through this week. If there's, like, one. If there's, like, one, one of the lawyers who may be more open to engaging with something like this. Like have them.  \nThem: I think so.  \nMe: Test like one or two of these.  \nThem: No, I. I think they'll be excited to do so, for sure. Set this on. What does that do? Okay? And this is also, like, what we want to be able to do. I don't know. What? That's. Pretty cool.  \nMe: And I guess maybe clarifying would. Oh, in the lawyer. The lawyer would. Is the one filling this out.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: Okay, okay, as the first step here.  \nThem: So it depends on the. So this one's actually seen by two people. There's a legal account manager.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: That just verifies that all of these documents are there, that this information is correct, and then once they verify that everything is correct,  \nMe: Eah.  \nThem: Then they pass it over to an Alex for review. So it's technically two people would see this.  \nMe: Gotcha. So it's like it'll be. It'll be like a multi step. So there's probably maybe over engineering this but there's probably like a. Hey, a trigger of like a document with this title has gotten past the first stage. Well, I guess. I guess now you don't necessarily. Need that because the document the template already has.  \nThem: Y. Es. No, that's. That's good.  \nMe: Right.  \nThem: No, that's good. Honestly, like, if there's a way for us to get that type of. That type of metric or just to know, because I think that would actually help us understand where a document is in the process, maybe how many people have touched it. Because PandaDoc has reporting features that let you know. That this legal account manager, or LAM for short, this lamb, is touched 20 documents today. They touched 100 documents. Or this Alex reviewed how many documents and they were able to kind of. So, I mean, if there is something that could incorporate that, I think it might be worth researching or just, you know, testing for sure.  \nMe: Yeah. I just did a quick look. It seems like there's a. One of the triggers we have. So, like, right now, how do we have, like, that webhook trigger for a separate zap that you have? You could have a. There's a document status changed. And so I could. And I would need to figure out, like, the specific mechanics of. And this would be. Clarify. This would probably. This would. You'd want this to be a separate zap that you're running, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Okay? Got it.  \nMe: Not in this one. And so every time the document status change, like, maybe, like, documents in this folder move from this status to this status, Then we send the note about the next step or something like that.  \nThem: That's good. That's good.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Let me ask you this. So the, the information that it catches here in the webhook, right? What all types of sources are available to.  \nMe: Yeah. Yep.  \nThem: What can we provide as sources for this webhook?  \nMe: Can you expand? I guess it takes, like, JSON inputs.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Specifically. And so it won't like, you won't necessarily be able to, like, attach a document. Like, you would have to, like, include a link to a document and maybe, like, do some processing or something. But you can't, like, attach files as part of the post request. But it James take any. Like, it'll take any JSON. What's the word? Payload.  \nThem: And that's. Coding payload, okay? And that's. That's what I'm. I'm looking to understand is, okay? How do I connect this to our current system? To produce it, Right? So let me see if I can. I think I have one of these down here.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: See right quick. I've got to re edit. I forgot. See if I can do. That. So basically within our. From our side. I was just wanting to understand what I would need to do. To pass that information along. To be picked up because that would. That would really help us taking in sweet time. Sorry. So that would help us to further Automate. So if I understand how to feed this, because that's a great. Like, that's a great. That's a huge step in the right. In the right. In the right direction. Because it's feeding. The template, all the information that it needs. So I just want to FlowBuilder sure that. We have the process to feed AutomateFlow the information that it needs.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Then create the template so.  \nMe: Can you show me? Like, the current. Yeah, the current system.  \nThem: What? Is going on here? So I had a shortcut, but our quick links got deleted. Hold on, let me see if I can use this to get to. So. Weird. I haven't completely uninstall it. See if I can. Get. To it. Give me two seconds. I'm going to see if this loads. Give me two seconds.  \nMe: That.  \nThem: Back up to get this. Sulfur back in. This is Trisha, by the way. I think y'all talked already, right?  \nMe: Yeah, we did. Good to see you again.  \nThem: Y. Es. It's good to see you too. Hold on. Give me one second. All right, so we have it. On. I thought it was on Internet. I'm glad I pulled up. So, yeah, we actually. Hold on. What it means. This seems stupid, but I'll show you. Yeah, it was all because my Internet wasn't connected and it wasn't. Yeah, it likes to do stuff like that. Sounds quick. Hold on. Here we go. All right now, so. I restored you. Yeah. I've watched it do that before. I restored you, but they may have to re Add. Yeah. Every moment of my life, man. Every moment of my life. Because, look, whenever you come into your regular stuff, you won't find it in here. Like, really made me delete it and just. It really was completely. I restored it, but give me a minute. I may need to. To run the. Install? Yeah, the setup and let it go back through. Its.  \nMe: Hey, guys, I apologize, but I do I have to drop for my next conversation. But I think Charles, the main thing that would be I think is the key next step is like, how do you the in the question I would I would like is like, how do you pull information from your client system? And maybe I'll ping you an email. I'll send back my calendar schedule right for this. We can schedule something. Like, I have time. Like, Thursday, Friday, this week. We can, like, sit down in three minutes and work through that.  \nThem: Okay, Sounds good. What I'll do in the meantime is just kind of work through what you've already shown me, because I think that's a great first step to kind of get us there. So thank you again.  \nMe: Sounds good. Great. Awesome. Talk to you later.  \nThem: Thank. All right, now, take care.  \nMe: Bye. ",

So it's hard for us to say that, you know, all of our legal. We can't expose any of our documents to a third party. So in order to do so, we have to kind of keep everything in house.

If it is an automation, I feel like it. Could be, but just figuring out what that logic needs to be to say this documents get gets added. But then it also becomes an understanding of depending upon the type of filing, whether it's like a garnishment or, you know, a suit petition or just just the different types of filings determines where documents fall within the packet because they have to organize the pages in a certain, in a certain fashion. So that becomes pretty manual. Just to know this page goes before, before the court documents or goes within the core documents or which ones gets removed before it gets filed, you know, so those are, those are some of the manual touches on that packet.

And I guess if we think of, like, impact versus effort, like an impact versus effort matrix, like, there's probably something that's, like, maybe medium impact, relatively low effort, and I'm thinking in specific context of like, hey, if we got, if we have you guys start a AutomateFlow trial, and that's a two week trial, and we can, we can end up extending if we need to.

So we're going through and templatizing. The, the documents that we're currently getting scanned in. So once those are made into templates, then we can properly pass that document on to team to team, we can track the document, that sort of a thing. But there's. There's.

So it'll be tied to, like, their Panda Doc accounts. Theoretically. And that might. Might be, like, a good, specific thing to test as you're working through this week. If there's, like, one. If there's, like, one, one of the lawyers who may be more open to engaging with something like this. Like have them."

That type of metric or just to know, because I think that would actually help us understand where a document is in the process, maybe how many people have touched it. Because PandaDoc has reporting features that let you know. That this legal account manager, or LAM for short, this lamb, is touched 20 documents today. They touched 100 documents. Or this Alex reviewed how many documents and they were able to kind of. So, I mean, if there is something that could incorporate that, I think it might be worth researching or just, you know, testing for sure."

So, like, right now, how do we have, like, that webhook trigger for a separate zap that you have? You could have a. There's a document status changed. And so I could. And I would need to figure out, like, the specific mechanics of. And this would be. Clarify. This would probably. This would. You'd want this to be a separate zap that you're running, if that makes sense."

To pass that information along. To be picked up because that would. That would really help us taking in sweet time. Sorry. So that would help us to further Automate. So if I understand how to feed this, because that's a great. Like, that's a great. That's a huge step in the right. In the right. In the right direction. Because it's feeding. The template, all the information that it needs. So I just want to FlowBuilder sure that. We have the process to feed AutomateFlow the information that it needs."

What it means. This seems stupid, but I'll show you. Yeah, it was all because my Internet wasn't connected and it wasn't. Yeah, it likes to do stuff like that. Sounds quick. Hold on. Here we go. All right now, so. I restored you. Yeah. I've watched it do that before. I restored you, but they may have to re Add. Yeah. Every moment of my life, man. Every moment of my life. Because, look, whenever you come into your regular stuff, you won't find it in here. Like, really made me delete it and just. It really was completely. I restored it, but give me a minute.

And maybe I'll ping you an email. I'll send back my calendar schedule right for this. We can schedule something. Like, I have time. Like, Thursday, Friday, this week.

Sorry about yesterday. We got a couple things we're trying to get out before the New Year.  \nMe: No worries at all. Trisha was telling me about kind of the issues you guys were having with Pandadoc and just kind of those last minute, last minute fires. I've been there for product launches more than once since everybody works until you put it until you're on. Maybe actually to use this and then. Something. And it's like. Then you're like, when we were building this, how did we not know this was going to be a problem? But every time, there's some new thing that no one knew was coming. So I've been there a hundred times, no worries. Sorry, I think you're muted.  \nThem: How about now?  \nMe: That worked. Okay.  \nThem: Okay. No, I get. It's the headset. They got a little button on it. No, that literally happened five minutes ago. It was like, hey, by the way, can we legally share this with a third party? So it's a launch tomorrow. Let me double check, okay? All right. I'm just going to take any stride, so. No. Exactly what you said. Things change. But no, we're definitely. I'm excited to see what you guys offer, just in the sense of not only for this process, but we have a lot of automations here that are. I don't know if you shared some of that with you. But I have some larger goals for what I'm looking to do as well. And some of that includes, like, we're doing a lot of things in Power Automate. And some other automations that just. They were created before anybody that works here. Was working here, and it's a little cumbersome, it's a little problematic, and I just was looking at other avenues to transfer that into something that's more reliable. That can be maintained that we have some support around. So I didn't know AutomateFlow. I saw where they had some enterprise wide type of automation.  \nMe: Yeah, we have quite a bit. Could you talk to me? Maybe not necessarily the specific automations, but you'd said you had a couple of goals for the company and maybe the only context I had, Trisha mentioned basically on the IT side, had eaten building developments, basically like you and her, which really just means you and so you're kind of doing all of the actual build here, trying to sort of move them forward from a technology perspective, from your ideal state. Like, let's say you could wave a magic wand a year from now. What is different about the way that Eastpoint does business from what it is today?  \nThem: It's a great question. And I just started in October. But just. If I had to look at it from my perspective right now, We would be able to ingest. There's a stop, because there's an overarching thing that's just never going to go anywhere. And I'm still too new to even speak on it. But right now, one of the things that we use consistently, and it's a pretty proprietary, it's called cls, or Collection Master. And I think Trish should probably gave you some insight into that. But it is our everything that we do to process debt claims, track clients, track everything within this one system. I would love to see that be in a certain state, but outside of that, just allowing the staff that's here to work within that and have everything that it's currently doing. Like, right now, we have, like, a Word document that gets produced via a word merge, and it takes some script and it takes some template. Like having those templates in a system such as a Pandadoc and allow us to. Trigger off to say, like, hey. This document is no longer in pin. It's now out of cls. It's in Panda. Doc. It's going to the right bucket of people that need to review it, they can sign it. And once it's signed, and then it automates and goes to the next person's assign. And then there's another trigger that takes it out of PandaDoc or takes it out of our folder. And pushes it to iperform or I mean, I would love to say that you guys could file it with the court for us, but they don't have a real system for that. So we have a team that we work with that's going to actually file it with the court. So now all of our filings are automated from end to end. It becomes a seamless book it to where people know what they have to do for tomorrow. They know what they're doing today, they know how much they've accomplished today. We can have reporting around what it takes to FlowBuilder that happen, like maybe how long it documents been out where it is in the signing process and if there's any timelines, we can actually put metrics around it. And then beyond that, there are certain automations that I'm still learning about because there is like a hands on tech person, but he's kind of in the weeds with keeping things going. How they're going to.  \nMe: More like maybe like a tech support type role. Like someone's laptop goes down if, like, if you can't connect to our emails, that kind of thing.  \nThem: Exactly. So he's been maintaining a lot of the automations. They're trying to keep up with the automations, but as things change and as we add on more clients, there's other new things. There's changes, there's updates to these automations that can't take place, and a lot of these automations, they have to be kicked off manually. So it's an automation, but it's more of like, it's a process that requires an automat, that requires a manual trigger. So all of those automations that are requiring manual triggers or any type of, like we do scrubs on clients to see where they work or just the type of if they've ever been in the military service. We're really pursuing clients to understand we're pursuing debt. It's just the name of the justice, what we're doing. So we have these different scrubs that we're doing to collect consumer information. That we're paying for a subscription to it. We're LexisNex is where all of the things to find people but there's automations that could be in place to give us and to gather this information, but it's not in place even down to the point of. Even in accounting. They have some automations or some things that they're doing manually that I would love to see become an automation that we can create and maintain. But what happens is right now I don't feel like we have an automation that we can trust to get the job done. Because automation's either fail or they skip or there's just no accountability to where even if an automation fails, there's nothing that comes back to even tell us like, hey, this didn't run last night, somebody needs to fix it. I don't know if that kind of answers the question, but that's kind of in my mind. If we get there, then I can think beyond that. Right. But like I said, In 12 months, I think if we get there, that would satisfy a lot of our current pain points to where, one, we can be more effective and efficient at what we're doing, and it would garner us or give us the opportunity to take on more clients or take on more filings and grow as a company, and then we can continue to walk down with that automation path. Might look like.  \nMe: Yeah. Y. Eah. That makes. That makes a ton of sense. I have a couple, like, fall questions just to try to get a sense of scale and scope of the effort here. Yesterday, Trisha mentioned that you're doing around, like, 300 intakes a day. I don't know. Is that, like, the right order of magnitude? When one of those intakes comes in today, how long does it take? Like, someone on your team, are they spending, like, an hour on it? Are they spending a day on it? I genuinely have no sense of, like, order of magnitude, context.  \nThem: No, it's okay. Like, there's a staff. Each process, there's a team of people that touches it, so it moves fairly quickly. But some of the things, some of. Our, like, you know, if something comes in, we can get it to like a demand stage pretty quickly. Like, we demand letter goes out. Like, we can get it through that process. So each process, each step might take. I guess there's no real general. And it just depends on what we're what, what we're digesting that day. But, you know, let's just for good numbers, maybe 30 minutes in the DOC team who takes it in, and maybe another hour, hour and a half for the client services team to put it into the system. And create the demand letter, then the demand letter goes out. Well, now that the demand letter is out, that's something. That's a document that we're sending out. But now, now we're on the clock.  \nMe: And I assume. Like, there's a person in your org who has to, like, find an email. Type it hit send. Right? Like that's not like auto generated or something like that.  \nThem: What? We have to print it. Like it? So with legal documents.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. With legal documents. We actually have to print those. So, you know, we actually have to mail out those letters to say that we've done our due diligence, to actually try to reach out to the debtor and give them the opportunity to pay the debt. I mean, that's the end game. Like, we hope that you want to pay it. We hope that we collect. So we're going to send out the letter to that person to say, like, let's collect the payment. But we also have to give them maybe 10 days to say, To respond. You know, so there's a window. That comes into play with some of the things that we do, or if we send out, like, an affidavit, you know, there's a window that we have to wait before we can act upon something. So all of these demand letters, judgment letters, garnishment letters, all of these are part of the documents that we send out per day, but there's kind of not like, there's not always an end to end. There's like a bucket of work, and each team has a bucket of work. And then we have maybe four or five. Yeah, we have like, maybe four or five teams.  \nMe: Like, clarifying questions, like, let's assume they're working in the cls, for example. So if I'm. If I'm the person who's, like, doing the mail outlet, or I might go into my CLS and see, like, a list of letters that I need to, like, review and mail out. Today, but it's not necessarily. Oh, it got to that last step. Now I'm going to auto generate the letters and have a human just like check to FlowBuilder sure they're good before sending type of things. Like there's a. There's some real like, human review steps involved right now. If I'M. Understanding correctly.  \nThem: Correct. So. Right. Maybe that is something. Well, some of it really can't be automated, but it could be placed. Maybe the automation could place in a bucket to where I can review it differently. Right. Because it still has to go for. For proper legal review. I can still has to. And then anything that goes out the door. Has to be reviewed by an Alex The same type of thing. Like, you know, so there are some things that we can't take out human interaction with, but it could be more streamlined to where it's like, now the Alex could see it in a bucket, and now he can kind of go through it that way.  \nMe: That makes sense. Okay. And then that, like, at least give me a little bit of idea of the process, I guess what is, what's like the error rate like today. Risks of like losing. I. I guess, I guess in the collections context, can you like risk losing a collections. Can like someone else reach out to them and get them to pay? Them instead of you? Like, is that, like, a thing that can happen? That might be a dumb question. I genuinely don't know.  \nThem: It's fair. I don't think that it is. It. It can. But majority of our clients, we're the only service or we're the largest servicer in the state. So with us being that primary, go to where there, it would be very rare that someone else is going after that client. They could just call and say, hey, I want to pay. Or they could just, you know, that could happen. But as far as, like, losing it and that, you know, in the scope of what you just described, I think it's. I think it's a very, very low percentage, like, single digit, for sure. But the, the rate of. Us, like, potentially missing a deadline. It gets a little higher just because there's nothing that's formally tracking it, or there's no. There's. It's harder for us to pull out those types of metrics out of. Out of the system to say, hey, this has been sitting out here 30 days. And if it's not done, you know, or if it's the 29th day and it's, you know, it's due by, we only have 30 day window, then we miss it or something's out there for two years and it can only be out there for, for so many months, you know. It's. It's those types of stipulations that are really saying that, yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. A ton of sense. Definitely understand if you don't have wouldn't have a sense of this, but, like. How much of. How much of your team's time is wasted today on those, like, types of error, like, in those. Like, in those spending time, I'm like, hey, this is, like, something we can't go after, or we missed it because we followed up on day 31 instead of, like, day 29. Like, just trying to get a sense of, like, how. How much has that actually happened? Because, like, I've seen some places where it's like, oh, we can theoretically have errors, but, like, we don't actually have them in practice. It doesn't actually hurt us that much.  \nThem: Right. We have staff members. That's all they do.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: That's how much it happens. Like it keeps them, you know, so it's working on rejects, working on. On fixes. Some of them are, you know, some of them, they're warranted rejects, or something's coming back because it needs further review or something changed on the file, but it's part. Of the normal process to where I would love to see that percentage or just that part of it decrease. And I think that we can add in some, you know, some tech resources that would help alleviate a lot of those and a lot of. A lot of what we're doing right now.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Is also a lot of interaction, like it's hand keyed, it's hand generated and if there's automations that can help. Transfer that data back and forth because some of it, we're pulling it from a digital file. Printing it out, keying it in, only to put it in another digital, you know, location. It's like, let's pull this in. Let's, you know.  \nMe: Y. Es.  \nThem: I've worked with, like, SSIs in the past, right? Like, I'm kind of that person. So I'm like, let's extract this into it. Let's transform, let's do all of the things and let's load it somewhere else. Like, I've. I've seen this happen.  \nMe: Yeah. Like, sure, we can print a copy, but, like, we don't need someone sitting there typing.  \nThem: Every single. Yeah, so that's that. So when I see some things in my mind.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like, is there a reason why we haven't just haven't had the bandwidth and then the growth also, you know, just to be fair, like, just the amount of volume that's increased within the company within 12 months is huge. So, you know, it's. Some of this. It worked fine or it wasn't. A necessity maybe 12 months ago, but now with the increase in volume, and the volume is going to be.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Fine. 300 a day. It falls apart at 3,000 a day. It's, like, literally impossible.  \nThem: Right. And the volume only continues to increase. So instead of waiting till it gets to that, you know, to a higher level of volume, if we're seeing, you know, we're seeing chinks and armor now, let's go ahead and try to address them and also set ourselves up to easier handle or pivot. Going forward as well.  \nMe: Okay. Super helpful. I. And I apologize for, like, all the questions, but I just. I was trying to just sort of build a mental model of, like, you're trying to do and playing back. And again, like, this is probably really straightforward, but really, it's, like, your goal a year from now, it's like, we. Want to be able to say, okay, from the time we get a notification that there's a collection to be done, like I whatever that process the court until we finish that collection or done the review, all of those steps we should be able to track. We should have a sense of how long they take if there's places where, where you can automate that connection. We should do it. If there's places where you need the human in the loop for, like, the legal requirements, of course, FlowBuilder shows those are there, but, like, try to streamline this as much as possible and if I'm hearing, like, even just be able to. Measure it in the first place? Because, like, if I'm understanding, you really don't even have like a baseline. Like, you maybe have like a sense, but there's not like a. Oh. On average it takes a two and a half hour cycle time. If we can get that down to two hours, then we. You. Know, we can do, like, five more a day or, like, have one less person doing this, or, like, whatever that might imply.  \nThem: That would be a huge metric, because even. Even down to the granularity of our cost, like, you know, our profiling cost. Right. So if we take on a new client, Let's say the client says that we want a business pursue all claims. So you want. If we. If you pursue a $500 claim, but it takes us 300 worth of filing fees. And four hours worth of a lawyer's time. And then another, however many hours. Now it's like, okay, you just spent $800 to pursue a $500 claim. Was it even worth it? But having that type of understanding of, you know, where we are, it would give us a better, you know, a better. Analysis of, you know, how. How we handle clients and what clients to take on and which ones are actually beneficial right now. It's like, you know, the higher the volume, the better. But we don't really have any. Any metrics around. Is that an actual. If that's factual or not?  \nMe: Yeah. Now that makes sense. That makes a ton of sense. And honestly, just even the fact that you're considering it, like, put you ahead of 90% of companies that I talk, as sad as it is, like, most companies aren't even, like, being thoughtful about, am I putting the time and effort into this that, like, is worth the return for whatever.  \nThem: Nice. There you go.  \nMe: In this or even, like, can I? Am I efficient in the way that we operate? As an example, maybe not necessarily the same thing, but like on the sales side at AutomateFlow, like if I get a lead in, we have so many like automations that like route it to me. They like let. Then my manager is alerted if I don't like follow up with in a certain time period that I'm supposed to. And then, like, after the fact, we have, like, agents that go do and do, like, close loss reports. Like, why did this still get lost? Was there things we could have done different? All of that kind of stuff just, like, helps you as a business FlowBuilder much more informed decisions, even if, like, each individual. Decision doesn't feel like drastically different. They all add up to, like, a much, much smoother process.  \nThem: Yeah. I love to just even hear that, because it. It is. And, you know, at a certain point in time, they used to have to be a human interaction with each one of those points that you just described. But, you know, now it's automations that can, you know, send triggers and reports and you follow ups. And schedule a meeting. Like, this guy's done this 10 times. Like, now you've hit, you know, not you, but you know what I'm saying? Like, somebody say the trigger. Like, he's got 10 new clients this month. Let's bring them in and have a meeting and see what he's. Doing, right? You know, those sorts of things. So I love it.  \nMe: Exactly. Exactly. Okay, this is super helpful so I can. I'm trying to think. What would be best to show you. Because, like, have you used AutomateFlow before, like, the actual, like, product, like, the drag and drop, how, like, the connections work? Because I think showing you that would be helpful and then want to give it give you a sense of, like, how we tend to think about partnering with businesses, particularly at for, like, the sort of transformation that you're imagining. I know that you guys have, like, a. Hey, we're trying to get this process done, like, right now. There's sort of, like, one condition we need to do. We can get that up and running for you guys. I think that's, like, probably a good, like, test. Not even test. Case, but like a good. Just sort of like how. How this works and then what we can probably. What probably makes sense for like, you and I spent some time like, okay, in an ideal world, like, let's. Let's like, lay out over the next 12 months, like what. What sort of like the sequence is and. Again. Like, these things James change. Like, I'm sure. I'm sure we'll get a month. That won't be exactly right, but, like, it can at least give us a sense of, like, how to work against what you laid out. Because what you described is, like, we have lots of customers, and I'M not sure in like this exact same business, but like law firms, consulting firms and like other like a lot of like consumer product businesses that are like, have these same types of processes that customers do. And honestly, a lot of it I think would be. I'll send you what are examples of like they called it's our lead management, like, templates, like, so and so. I think that's, like, at least a good starting point to, like, conceptually how we think about, like, oh, we have this huge ingestion, and there's, like, these different flows in the process.  \nThem: Intro to like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Yes.  \nMe: So like that type of example, so.  \nThem: To answer your question, I haven't interacted with it much. But, you know, it's. Interestingly enough, I've heard about it so many from so many sources. It's like, oh, you can. So I have a company. I do bike rentals and things like that. Right. Well, they were like, well, look. You can use AutomateFlow to. To integrate with your customers. Move your customers over into this booking software. And the booking software, AutomateFlow open for a calendar invite. And for. I'm like, all right. And then I get here and I'm like, you guys came up again. And, you know, and I've heard it multiple times. So it's like, let me dig deeper while I have the opportunity to do so.  \nMe: Let me. Let me share my screen here.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Especially for someone like you, has like the technical background. It's not going to be anything like earth shattering, but it is just like a really easy, straightforward way to.  \nThem: No, that's cool. I'm. I'm good with that.  \nMe: Out system. So there's sort of two processes, and if you're for someone who's like, not at all technical, you could have a copilot here. And actually, let's, actually, let's, let's do this as an example. So we have right now. It's like, hey, Panda. It's like the PandaDoc document. Is signed. Okay, so I have. A Panda doc document. Then I'm getting signed. When it's done. I want to extract. A specific set of fields. And the cls you guys used, you said it's, like, proprietary. Can you FlowBuilder, like, just, like, an API call? To it.  \nThem: Yes. API, webhooks, and then we have access to the database on the back end of it as well.  \nMe: Okay? That I need to. FlowBuilder. Transfer the information. From. From panda, doc. So something like this, it's going to. It's going to go through. Do some thinking. It'll search our well. That's loading. So it'll search like our apps database to see. Okay, what do we have available? It'll find PandaDoc there. It'll be like, oh, we don't have a custom cls, so it's going to need a document complete trigger. And then there's like a. Basically a code by AutomateFlow Step or. Oh, okay. This case, he's going to use a web hook to FlowBuilder a post request to the to the a custom API documentation and fortune. One thing to Flex. I don't think this is an issue for you. Right. Like you do still need to know how to do the API call, right? So, like, for. For something where there's not already the integration in place, you'll need to build some of this custom stuff. But for 99% of things, we're going to already have the systems. And it sounds like you guys are a Microsoft office shop like a365. So like you know, Outlook, Excel teams all those types of things you can triggers off of that people have or we often or we see what's it called it's like.  \nThem: Okay? Nice.  \nMe: Server, Microsoft server. I forget what it's called the top of my head, but there's like the new hire server for Microsoft. Like when, when you, when you, when someone joins the team, you have to like, provision an Outlook email for them and like, all that kind of stuff. Like, those are, those are types of things. That we have people doing as well.  \nThem: SQL server.  \nMe: So it's not like on the customer facing side, but there's like, even on the, like, internal operations stuff, there's like, lots of things that people.  \nThem: Oh, that's nice. No, that's really good, because when we get a new hire, there's a list of things that we have to do, right? So if we can trigger something that would send the email for this access, right. And, you know, request this email, like, that would be great. You know, it takes that burden off.  \nMe: Exactly. Oh.  \nThem: That's cool.  \nMe: Exactly. And then, so here, like, it does the initial, like, template, it pulls it for you. But you would actually. I don't have a Panda Doc Login, so I can't, like, log in here, but.  \nThem: I can.  \nMe: If you want to go up and share screen, we can do it on your side, but you would have to, like, log in, look at the document that's created, and there, here on the post request, this is where. Okay, what's the URL we're talking about? What's the payload? I think there's also my personal preference, transparently, is instead of the post request, I prefer the code by AutomateFlow just because I'm a Python guy. And so this, like, this, like, just lets you, like, FlowBuilder the Python call instead of, like, having to figure out which URL the post request. But like, both of those. Work equally well, Kind of. Whatever.  \nThem: Oh, wow. Okay?  \nMe: Whatever your preferences are for something like that.  \nThem: That's pretty cool that you still have. You know, you. You have the option.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And, like, it's. The whole thing here is, like, flexibility, right? Like, the ideal should be, you know, someone who is, like, not at all technical once to go to PandaDoc and create a spreadsheet, add a row to a spreadsheet every time it goes like that is super easy to do. You can do it built in, never leaving this interface. No need to code. If you're doing, like, more complex, more touching, different systems or systems that, like, don't have AutomateFlow integrations already because they don't want to FlowBuilder them or your own in custom systems that you guys have, then you can. Like go that step above to build in some of these code steps. The other thing I would flag too, that might be relevant for you guys, and this is like maybe a farther down the line thing you we can also do custom, like custom actions. So like one example, let me like use SalesCloud as an example because this is something I use quite a bit. But we have. We have the events here. So, like, this is. These are the ones that, like SalesCloud, made an integration with AutomateFlow. They included a bunch of, like, find different elements, do research.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: But there's stuff that, like, we, like. I wanted to. Okay, I wanted to get all the notes from a contact in SalesCloud automatically that didn't exist as an action. And so I went and, like, made this custom action.  \nThem: Wow. Nice.  \nMe: Let's see. Don't load. Well, let me. I'm not sure why. It's not why it's filtering here. Because there shouldn't be. Okay. Sorry. For some reason,  \nThem: No, you're good.  \nMe: For some reason, it's not letting me go to the full list, but even this is an example of one of, like, literally, you just, like, chat with it. Like, what are you trying to do?  \nThem: Okay, okay.  \nMe: And you do the build out the code yourself. You know, it like, the whole point is it's like the full range of flexibility from, you know, just drag and drop. And then like, okay, let's say you wanted to build FlowBuilder it easier for someone else to build on top of. Later you can build a custom action so that the next person can just do the drag and drop if they want to, right?  \nThem: Awesome. Nice, nice. No, and that's huge because you even help me to remember, like, even on the accounting pieces, there's so many. So many things that are currently being manually done, even to the fact of, like. Document creation, But I'm sorry, that went to a different department. But even in our accounting, like, they're taking, you know, they're doing something like taking a spreadsheet, manipulating the spreadsheet and then having to manually upload it somewhere. Right, but there's the same set of rules, the way. They manipulate the spreadsheet or that they format the spreadsheet. That can be done automatically every single time. And it does. Every time I see it, it's just like, if I had hair, I'd be like, ah, you know, why are you doing it this way? But they don't have any other. Way to do it. And, you know, before I go, I didn't want to go. I'm one of those, like, okay, yeah, maybe I can get them to, you know, add in this SSIS and all the other older pieces that I've used. But let me see what else is out here, right? So. And. This is. This looks great, man. Just even, like, the interface, being able to. Because we are. We're in an AI driven, you know, environment, and it's. We. We use our copilot pretty often.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: You know, they encourage it, actually, and it helps with a lot of things to where, you know, I was doing a comparative, like, so we're going to E filing, right? Like, that's our big initiative. So Louisiana has never had to E file. But going from the first forward, we James no longer be able to mail in our suits or our emotions or whatever we want to file with the courts. So I'm just looking through the courts and I'm. I need to create a comparison list. So I just dropped out three different files there, wrote the verbiage in there, you know, the right prompt, and here comes the list of. All the courts.  \nMe: Y. Es.  \nThem: From all three different documents, which ones are on which software, which, you know, like. So I don't mind interacting with the AI to help get it done. So the fact that this meets everyone here in the organization where they are, it's in. It keeps everything in house. Where? Okay, well, now I can see. Like, hey, let's sit down and let's talk about what you created.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Do you need a report from this? Do you need it to generate at a certain time? You know it takes the onus off of me to just say I have to collect everybody's information or everybody's need. No. Let's all get in here. Drop your things in here. And now we'll schedule. A time around it to where? Let's revisit this. And now it's. You know, we can really start working through that burn down list, if you James.  \nMe: Y. Eah, no, that, that. And like, when I know I talked about, like, yeah, we can like, sort of build that backlog. And that was just sort of in that one customer facing you. Right. Like, you have that same backlog for your finance accounting team, your operations team, your HR teams. Like, all of those people we have and it's one of. It's kind of hard because, like, AutomateFlow is really just kind of like the. The mesh layer that sits under the tools you use. Like, so it. It is really kind of like the. The sort of. The imagination is the limit on sort of, like, what people are able to do.  \nThem: Yeah. Y. Eah, yeah. Nice.  \nMe: I think my initial thought is what would be, what would FlowBuilder the most sense would be to have you start like, building out like this, like, this, like, specific flow that you, that you need to. For like the PandaDoc to, to the API call, like, use that as sort of a test case, answer any question, like, work through it, like, deal with any, like, issues you have, pinging me for questions, and then what is the timeline? That one that, like, I know you guys are trying to get this up sort of like, basically now.  \nThem: Okay? Yeah.  \nMe: I can meet again as soon as tomorrow. Or I. We could say like, hey, like the. For like that. That next Monday after the New Year's Eve. Kind of what would be most helpful, because then. So actually, let me take a step back. Basically what I'm imagining is like, okay, we like, try this, try this. See if it works for you and that, like, using our, like, free teams trial, where you can just, like, go and you'll get access to, like, the full stuff, like the levels that you use for two weeks, kind of like just whatever you need. Then we can sit down. It's like, okay, this actually does FlowBuilder sense, build out sort of like, for those. For that, like, vision that you laid out. What. What is sort of, like the business case that we can, like, go FlowBuilder Tisha that, like, hey, this is going to be worth it if we can, like, if we can solve these four things over the next 12 months.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Then it is worthwhile for us to, like, actually do, like, a more robust partnership, more of U.S. investment, because the team, like, and in particular, the main thing that's there is, like, having people on the AutomateFlow side who, like, know the direction that you're trying to go, know your business. So, like, let's say one of your zaps fails, and you're like, oh, did the API that I'm connected to go down the legal team change theirs?  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: And, like, a lot of times, like, you just, like, there's just, like, no way to know unless someone's really deep into the weeds. And, like, that's the kind of thing where, like, having, like, a technical account manager on our side from the AutomateFlow side can be helpful, but that only makes sense. If it like, if you actually are going to get enough value from integrating it across the business. And I think the thing to figure out.  \nThem: There you go.  \nMe: There, Honestly, it's just like, transparently, just like, how much appetite is there for. Is there for automation beyond these things? Because I think sometimes, and I do this too, where it's like, this would be great, but, like, no one's actually going to sit down to do it. And if that's the case it's not valuable, right? Like, if it's just, like, if it's just there in theory of like and no one and like, if no one in your accounting team is going to be willing to do a new process because, like, because they're like, oh, I don't trust the computer, and. Like it's going to do it wrong. You know what I mean? Like, I've been in. I've been in those situations, like, the change management more so than the, like, technical self. And we need to figure, I think, figuring out some of those pieces, we can sort of build a case of like, okay, what? Does it look like for AutomateFlow to help Eastpoint, like, you know, in 2025, get to a place where we can measure the effect of our processes, measure how quickly we're doing deals, measure our error rate. Maybe instead of, like, three people responding to errors, we can go down to two, like, all of those. Types of things that you can think about. So I'll pause there. That's kind of like how I'm thinking about us working, sequencing, working together, like getting this built for you and then sort of like building a case to say, can we do some of this other stuff farther down the line?  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a great approach. So what ended up happening, right? As we got a little bit closer and a little deeper into this meeting, our deadline for the first, we shifted gears a little bit, Right? So instead of us trying to adding these templates that we're going to need, the calls from AutomateFlow and from all of the different resources. We went with a short term fix to get us there. And then by the 15th, I would love to start. That would kind of be my, my go live or incorporation full on incorporation date for the piece that we need to transfer the information from our CLS system into our templates within, you know, even a small set because we have a lot of templates we're working through. But even, even for us to even say, like, hey, if we can just get our demand letters, might be like, our first stage, even for us to just have an automation that would enable us to create those demand letters. So, you know, it is, it's a pretty. It's a pretty. It's pretty fast moving or a good pace, you know, so I'm on board with it for sure. Does it have to be this week? Probably not just so we can go ahead and get the training. I still have. We have 140. Course we deal with. I still have to, you know, contact them. I'm still building out the training manuals and getting everybody in the right team and my biggest goal from doing it this way. Now one we're up and running to. The staff is familiar with Pandadoc. Everyone's logged into PandaDoc. Everybody has their own, you know, I don't have. While they're busy doing that. We can take our time in the sense of now. We can dedicate. I can dedicate a day, I can dedicate two days to further building it out, because the deadline is behind us and all they know is it's only going to get better. So that, that way. And I also agree that building those use cases because one of the benefits of being here is the owners and Trisha especially, she sees it like, you know, she's our cfo, but she, she codes in Python. Like, she does a lot of her own automations. Like her, her computer bag has more trinkets in it than mine does, you know, and I'm in data, so I think that it's at the right time to show those use cases and to really build out the process, because like I said, the way, the way to savvy, you know, and the people been carrying this burden for a while. So if there is something, like, I was brought in to help do these things that we're discussing, like, you know, so, you know, I even taught Tricia. I'm like, look, I've been doing some research, and I think that AutomateFlow is more than just the fix for this. She was. Like, well, schedule a meeting and let's go forward. Right? So that's kind of where I am. So I think that the approach that you have described would be right on par with what I would need to get us going and, you know, moving us forward for 20, 26, for sure.  \nMe: Yeah. That sounds awesome. So I guess then just, like, super tactically, do you want to, like, aim to meet sometime? Basically, like the week of the 5th. So if I'm thinking, okay, you want to have it done by the 15th, give you this week to get the trainings done. I want to basically have us be able to sit down and, like, work through it in depth, just so you can actually sort of FlowBuilder sure the connections work. FlowBuilder sure, like, start the trial for the two weeks, so you could, like, play around with it as much you guys want to and all that jazz, and then we can. Like, just FlowBuilder sure that. And then using the 15th as sort of like a. Okay, let's go live with, like, at least this initial one. And then maybe, like. And this is, like, something we can think about later. But I'm thinking once that's live, then we can say, okay, maybe sometime in the week. Of the 19th, we can have a. Let's sit down, walk, Trish. Like, you and I can have it aligned on these use cases. We could have built out some base roi like, hey, Trisha, does this FlowBuilder sense? Like, we've laid out, like, these, like, five different, like, things that we want to build this. Year. Like, how many of these can we actually do? Okay, if we do these two, is it still worth it to, like, integrate AutomateFlow, to, like, try to have that sort of conversation? High level sort of what I'm thinking.  \nThem: Yeah. No, I agree.  \nMe: All that said, that could get us, like, early February, where of, like, okay, we get to buy in, and then, like, we can actually start having our TAMS work with you guys to move, like, move forward. And again, like, obviously, things move around as we as things dig in. There'll be additional questions. Maybe there's other people in the org that we need to bring along, but I think high level, that would get us like, hey, you have this built by the 15th, and then by the end of January, you're set up to, like, start running for the year.  \nThem: No, that's great. I agree. So I also kind of. I'm one of those where, if I can answer the question right, I kind of put the. I put it out there. I'm like, so, look, we're starting with this. This is the first. Two weeks from there, we'll have something else two weeks from there. So I told him every two weeks until we get there, we're going to have something updating or something changing in the process. So this is right on par. You know, that's why I was, you know, kind of telling Trisha, like, No, I know we're in the middle of this rollout, but I want to have this meeting because I want to be able to stick to my two week deadline of every two weeks, there's some type of change or some update you can look for. You know, you can tell our clients, like, every two weeks. You know, now it's showing face to them that, no, we are evolving like we've been in the game since. 60, 70, 19, 70, something like that. You know, like, we've been in this game for a long time, but now that you know, and we won a ton of awards, but we're always on the cutting edge of what's going forward, and this James show them that, no, we're making the change to do. So. So what you described is I'm spot on. So, I mean. I don't know if the 6 would work. Good for you. Six or seven.  \nMe: Could you do, like, 11? What times are you in? Okay, could you do. Could you do, like, 11 on the 6th?  \nThem: Central. Let me. See? Yes.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: That'll work.  \nMe: I'll send that invite. I James also. So I'll send that invite. I'll also send over just some, like, basic, like, getting started with AutomateFlow stuff like that we often find is helpful. And I'll also lay out, like, that timeline that we discussed. And what I usually do. I'll show you an example from, like, another client that I'm working with, what I James often do. To help sort of guide that ROI conversation we're having is I'll put together something like this based off of what we discuss. So we're like, these are the use cases. How much time do we expect? Like, estimate savings at least. And this gives us something to, like, talk to. So I'll put this together based off of what we discussed as well. And then I'll send that invite for the time on the 6th.  \nThem: Nice. Yeah. Yeah. I love.  \nMe: And. Yeah, let's. Let's. Let's. Let's get you guys built out. Sounds very exciting.  \nThem: Man. This is exciting for me as well, man. And I appreciate your enthusiasm, your professionalism and just your knowledge of the tool. Because, you know, when people from having these calls understand, like, I don't have to know why you're asking the questions, you know, why you're answering asking the questions. Right. So let me give you as much transparency as I can, and I'm excited to see where this goes, but I think. I think we have something great. And I'll definitely follow up with Tricia as well and just tell her, you know, call went great, and I'm excited to see what these integrations look like. Because it has to happen.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: You know, regardless of, you know, what. What. What the priority is, like, I'm. I'm in a good position to help push that initiative for what I'm here to do, so I'm excited.  \nMe: Awesome. Awesome. Okay, charles. Happy new year.  \nThem: Happy new year.  \nMe: We'll talk again shortly after. And let's. Let's get these sprints. Let's do these.  \nThem: Love it. Love it. All right, bro, have a good one. ",

No. Exactly what you said. Things change. But no, we're definitely. I'm excited to see what you guys offer, just in the sense of not only for this process, but we have a lot of automations here that are. I don't know if you shared some of that with you. But I have some larger goals for what I'm looking to do as well. And some of that includes, like, we're doing a lot of things in Power Automate. And some other automations that just. They were created before anybody that works here. Was working here, and it's a little cumbersome, it's a little problematic, and I just was looking at other avenues to transfer that into something that's more reliable. That can be maintained that we have some support around. So I didn't know AutomateFlow. I saw where they had some enterprise wide type of automation."

Maybe not necessarily the specific automations, but you'd said you had a couple of goals for the company and maybe the only context I had, Trisha mentioned basically on the IT side, had eaten building developments, basically like you and her, which really just means you and so you're kind of doing all of the actual build here, trying to sort of move them forward from a technology perspective, from your ideal state. Like, let's say you could wave a magic wand a year from now. What is different about the way that Eastpoint does business from what it is today?"

          "text": "It's a great question. And I just started in October. But just. If I had to look at it from my perspective right now, We would be able to ingest. There's a stop, because there's an overarching thing that's just never going to go anywhere. And I'm still too new to even speak on it. But right now, one of the things that we use consistently, and it's a pretty proprietary, it's called cls, or Collection Master. And I think Trish should probably gave you some insight into that. But it is our everything that we do to process debt claims, track clients, track everything within this one system. I would love to see that be in a certain state, but outside of that, just allowing the staff that's here to work within that and have everything that it's currently doing. Like, right now, we have, like, a Word document that gets produced via a word merge, and it takes some script and it takes some template. Like having those templates in a system such as a Pandadoc and allow us to. Trigger off to say, like, hey. This document is no longer in pin. It's now out of cls. It's in Panda. Doc. It's going to the right bucket of people that need to review it, they can sign it. And once it's signed, and then it automates and goes to the next person's assign. And then there's another trigger that takes it out of PandaDoc or takes it out of our folder. And pushes it to iperform or I mean, I would love to say that you guys could file it with the court for us, but they don't have a real system for that. So we have a team that we work with that's going to actually file it with the court. So now all of our filings are automated from end to end. It becomes a seamless book it to where people know what they have to do for tomorrow. They know what they're doing today, they know how much they've accomplished today. We can have reporting around what it takes to FlowBuilder that happen, like maybe how long it documents been out where it is in the signing process and if there's any timelines, we can actually put metrics around it. And then beyond that, there are certain automations that I'm still learning about because there is like a hands on tech person, but he's kind of in the weeds with keeping things going. How they're going to."

          "text": "Exactly. So he's been maintaining a lot of the automations. They're trying to keep up with the automations, but as things change and as we add on more clients, there's other new things. There's changes, there's updates to these automations that can't take place, and a lot of these automations, they have to be kicked off manually. So it's an automation, but it's more of like, it's a process that requires an automat, that requires a manual trigger. So all of those automations that are requiring manual triggers or any type of, like we do scrubs on clients to see where they work or just the type of if they've ever been in the military service. We're really pursuing clients to understand we're pursuing debt. It's just the name of the justice, what we're doing. So we have these different scrubs that we're doing to collect consumer information. That we're paying for a subscription to it. We're LexisNex is where all of the things to find people but there's automations that could be in place to give us and to gather this information, but it's not in place even down to the point of. Even in accounting. They have some automations or some things that they're doing manually that I would love to see become an automation that we can create and maintain. But what happens is right now I don't feel like we have an automation that we can trust to get the job done. Because automation's either fail or they skip or there's just no accountability to where even if an automation fails, there's nothing that comes back to even tell us like, hey, this didn't run last night, somebody needs to fix it. I don't know if that kind of answers the question, but that's kind of in my mind. If we get there, then I can think beyond that. Right. But like I said, In 12 months, I think if we get there, that would satisfy a lot of our current pain points to where, one, we can be more effective and efficient at what we're doing, and it would garner us or give us the opportunity to take on more clients or take on more filings and grow as a company, and then we can continue to walk down with that automation path. Might look like."

Yesterday, Trisha mentioned that you're doing around, like, 300 intakes a day. I don't know. Is that, like, the right order of magnitude? When one of those intakes comes in today, how long does it take? Like, someone on your team, are they spending, like, an hour on it? Are they spending a day on it?

So each process, each step might take. I guess there's no real general. And it just depends on what we're what, what we're digesting that day. But, you know, let's just for good numbers, maybe 30 minutes in the DOC team who takes it in, and maybe another hour, hour and a half for the client services team to put it into the system. And create the demand letter, then the demand letter goes out. Well, now that the demand letter is out, that's something. That's a document that we're sending out. But now, now we're on the clock."

I mean, that's the end game. Like, we hope that you want to pay it. We hope that we collect. So we're going to send out the letter to that person to say, like, let's collect the payment. But we also have to give them maybe 10 days to say, To respond. You know, so there's a window. That comes into play with some of the things that we do, or if we send out, like, an affidavit, you know, there's a window that we have to wait before we can act upon something. So all of these demand letters, judgment letters, garnishment letters, all of these are part of the documents that we send out per day, but there's kind of not like, there's not always an end to end. There's like a bucket of work, and each team has a bucket of work. And then we have maybe four or five. Yeah, we have like, maybe four or five teams."

And then anything that goes out the door. Has to be reviewed by an Alex The same type of thing.

Or they could just, you know, that could happen. But as far as, like, losing it and that, you know, in the scope of what you just described, I think it's. I think it's a very, very low percentage, like, single digit, for sure. But the, the rate of. Us, like, potentially missing a deadline. It gets a little higher just because there's nothing that's formally tracking it, or there's no. There's. It's harder for us to pull out those types of metrics out of. Out of the system to say, hey, this has been sitting out here 30 days. And if it's not done, you know, or if it's the 29th day and it's, you know, it's due by, we only have 30 day window, then we miss it or something's out there for two years and it can only be out there for, for so many months, you know.

If there's places where you need the human in the loop for, like, the legal requirements, of course, FlowBuilder shows those are there, but, like, try to streamline this as much as possible and if I'm hearing, like, even just be able to. Measure it in the first place? Because, like, if I'm understanding, you really don't even have like a baseline. Like, you maybe have like a sense, but there's not like a. Oh.

That won't be exactly right, but, like, it can at least give us a sense of, like, how to work against what you laid out.

This case, he's going to use a web hook to FlowBuilder a post request to the to the a custom API documentation and fortune. One thing to Flex. I don't think this is an issue for you. Right. Like you do still need to know how to do the API call, right? So, like, for. For something where there's not already the integration in place, you'll need to build some of this custom stuff. But for 99% of things, we're going to already have the systems. And it sounds like you guys are a Microsoft office shop like a365.

You can do it built in, never leaving this interface. No need to code. If you're doing, like, more complex, more touching, different systems or systems that, like, don't have AutomateFlow integrations already because they don't want to FlowBuilder them or your own in custom systems that you guys have, then you can. Like go that step above to build in some of these code steps. The other thing I would flag too, that might be relevant for you guys, and this is like maybe a farther down the line thing you we can also do custom, like custom actions. So like one example, let me like use SalesCloud as an example because this is something I use quite a bit. But we have. We have the events here. So, like, this is.

Kind of what would be most helpful, because then. So actually, let me take a step back. Basically what I'm imagining is like, okay, we like, try this, try this. See if it works for you and that, like, using our, like, free teams trial, where you can just, like, go and you'll get access to, like, the full stuff, like the levels that you use for two weeks, kind of like just whatever you need. Then we can sit down. It's like, okay, this actually does FlowBuilder sense, build out sort of like, for those. For that, like, vision that you laid out. What. What is sort of, like the business case that we can, like, go FlowBuilder Tisha that, like, hey, this is going to be worth it if we can, like, if we can solve these four things over the next 12 months."

So, like, let's say one of your zaps fails, and you're like, oh, did the API that I'm connected to go down the legal team change theirs?"

And, like, that's the kind of thing where, like, having, like, a technical account manager on our side from the AutomateFlow side can be helpful, but that only makes sense. If it like, if you actually are going to get enough value from integrating it across the business. And I think the thing to figure out."

          "text": "There, Honestly, it's just like, transparently, just like, how much appetite is there for. Is there for automation beyond these things? Because I think sometimes, and I do this too, where it's like, this would be great, but, like, no one's actually going to sit down to do it. And if that's the case it's not valuable, right? Like, if it's just, like, if it's just there in theory of like and no one and like, if no one in your accounting team is going to be willing to do a new process because, like, because they're like, oh, I don't trust the computer, and. Like it's going to do it wrong. You know what I mean? Like, I've been in. I've been in those situations, like, the change management more so than the, like, technical self. And we need to figure, I think, figuring out some of those pieces, we can sort of build a case of like, okay, what? Does it look like for AutomateFlow to help Eastpoint, like, you know, in 2025, get to a place where we can measure the effect of our processes, measure how quickly we're doing deals, measure our error rate. Maybe instead of, like, three people responding to errors, we can go down to two, like, all of those. Types of things that you can think about. So I'll pause there. That's kind of like how I'm thinking about us working, sequencing, working together, like getting this built for you and then sort of like building a case to say, can we do some of this other stuff farther down the line?"

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a great approach. So what ended up happening, right? As we got a little bit closer and a little deeper into this meeting, our deadline for the first, we shifted gears a little bit, Right? So instead of us trying to adding these templates that we're going to need, the calls from AutomateFlow and from all of the different resources. We went with a short term fix to get us there. And then by the 15th, I would love to start. That would kind of be my, my go live or incorporation full on incorporation date for the piece that we need to transfer the information from our CLS system into our templates within, you know, even a small set because we have a lot of templates we're working through. But even, even for us to even say, like, hey, if we can just get our demand letters, might be like, our first stage, even for us to just have an automation that would enable us to create those demand letters. So, you know, it is, it's a pretty. It's a pretty. It's pretty fast moving or a good pace, you know, so I'm on board with it for sure. Does it have to be this week? Probably not just so we can go ahead and get the training. I still have. We have 140. Course we deal with. I still have to, you know, contact them. I'm still building out the training manuals and getting everybody in the right team and my biggest goal from doing it this way. Now one we're up and running to. The staff is familiar with Pandadoc. Everyone's logged into PandaDoc. Everybody has their own, you know, I don't have. While they're busy doing that. We can take our time in the sense of now. We can dedicate. I can dedicate a day, I can dedicate two days to further building it out, because the deadline is behind us and all they know is it's only going to get better. So that, that way. And I also agree that building those use cases because one of the benefits of being here is the owners and Trisha especially, she sees it like, you know, she's our cfo, but she, she codes in Python. Like, she does a lot of her own automations. Like her, her computer bag has more trinkets in it than mine does, you know, and I'm in data, so I think that it's at the right time to show those use cases and to really build out the process, because like I said, the way, the way to savvy, you know, and the people been carrying this burden for a while. So if there is something, like, I was brought in to help do these things that we're discussing, like, you know, so, you know, I even taught Tricia. I'm like, look, I've been doing some research, and I think that AutomateFlow is more than just the fix for this. She was. Like, well, schedule a meeting and let's go forward. Right? So that's kind of where I am. So I think that the approach that you have described would be right on par with what I would need to get us going and, you know, moving us forward for 20, 26, for sure."

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yeah. That sounds awesome. So I guess then just, like, super tactically, do you want to, like, aim to meet sometime? Basically, like the week of the 5th. So if I'm thinking, okay, you want to have it done by the 15th, give you this week to get the trainings done. I want to basically have us be able to sit down and, like, work through it in depth, just so you can actually sort of FlowBuilder sure the connections work. FlowBuilder sure, like, start the trial for the two weeks, so you could, like, play around with it as much you guys want to and all that jazz, and then we can. Like, just FlowBuilder sure that. And then using the 15th as sort of like a. Okay, let's go live with, like, at least this initial one. And then maybe, like. And this is, like, something we can think about later. But I'm thinking once that's live, then we can say, okay, maybe sometime in the week. Of the 19th, we can have a. Let's sit down, walk, Trish. Like, you and I can have it aligned on these use cases. We could have built out some base roi like, hey, Trisha, does this FlowBuilder sense? Like, we've laid out, like, these, like, five different, like, things that we want to build this. Year. Like, how many of these can we actually do? Okay, if we do these two, is it still worth it to, like, integrate AutomateFlow, to, like, try to have that sort of conversation? High level sort of what I'm thinking."

And again, like, obviously, things move around as we as things dig in. There'll be additional questions. Maybe there's other people in the org that we need to bring along, but I think high level, that would get us like, hey, you have this built by the 15th, and then by the end of January, you're set up to, like, start running for the year."

I'm like, so, look, we're starting with this. This is the first. Two weeks from there, we'll have something else two weeks from there. So I told him every two weeks until we get there, we're going to have something updating or something changing in the process. So this is right on par. You know, that's why I was, you know, kind of telling Trisha, like, No, I know we're in the middle of this rollout, but I want to have this meeting because I want to be able to stick to my two week deadline of every two weeks, there's some type of change or some update you can look for. You know, you can tell our clients, like, every two weeks. You know, now it's showing face to them that, no, we are evolving like we've been in the game since. 60, 70, 19, 70, something like that. You know, like, we've been in this game for a long time, but now that you know, and we won a ton of awards, but we're always on the cutting edge of what's going forward, and this James show them that, no, we're making the change to do. So. So what you described is I'm spot on. So, I mean. I don't know if the 6 would work. Good for you. Six or seven."

And what I usually do. I'll show you an example from, like, another client that I'm working with, what I James often do. To help sort of guide that ROI conversation we're having is I'll put together something like this based off of what we discuss. So we're like, these are the use cases. How much time do we expect? Like, estimate savings at least. And this gives us something to, like, talk to. So I'll put this together based off of what we discussed as well.

I forgot about the little piece of paper I have. How are you feeling?  \nMe: Just to FlowBuilder sure no one's watching. Otherwise,  \nThem: Alright. So I did get a email from, I got a email from, Corey. He ended up having to work a little late, so he's coming. It just might be a few minutes before he jumps in. I'm just kinda reviewing a email I just sent out. I think it's all right there. If not, I'll help out tomorrow. We're just still working out those kinks about the efiling, man. I just mister Eastpoint just told me he heard that one of the was kinda singing our praises because we actually got it right where all the other course are  \nMe: That's great.  \nThem: still having prop right. I'll take that.  \nMe: I know. Right?  \nThem: I I received that wholeheartedly. So, other than that, actually, get this out of my purview. SOP. It's not gonna follow the wave. Alright. Perfect. Yeah. So I was definitely I'm looking forward to just getting us some of this insight Also, I had a couple of things I wanted to go over with him automation wise, that Sadie sent over because just a little backstory.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Corey, Dustin, and Wes are the main people that have built a lot of the, the current structure we're still using. So, you know, he he has a he has the the knowledge of what what's there, why it was built, how it was structured, all of the things. So I mean, he quoted everything from the power automate on up. So, including this this word merge, piece is kinda big. I've been going through these templates with Sergio at PandaDoc, So, you know, that's something that I'm I'm hoping that we can get that type of understanding. Then we can go ahead and get things to automate, you know you know, to automate. So  \nMe: I put the full whole folder. That makes sense.  \nThem: yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay. And so and just clarifying. When you're saying, like, the word merge pieces, these are, like, like, what are the contract templates effectively that they use before? Is that am I thinking about that the right way? That, like,  \nThem: In a sense, so, you know, those the templates that we've been here, I'll actually show you a couple while we have time. So I got some open here. Share. Screen switch. This So these are actually this is the back end template So this is yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. I think I think you showed me one of these.  \nThem: Yeah. So these are actually filled in with procedures that Corey created.  \nMe: Gotcha. Okay.  \nThem: So, you know, this would give us the opportunity to really understand how looking for one more MS Word. Which one is this? I should've pulled up some of these. This would be helpful. D c d g. Just type it in. D g. But this James help us understand how we need to fill it. Like, if there's something specific,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: in CLS, that we have to get AutomateFlow to emulate to produce the same output. It's my thought. Excuse me. So, and he also I think he built built the templates. He'll have to fill me in. I've actually never met Corey before. Heard a lot about him, so this would be interesting to apparently, they have a there's a group that has meetings with them every Saturday.  \nMe: Oh, it's for the  \nThem: But so this like, all these  \nMe: proprietors of c u c c f o. Okay. Okay.  \nThem: yeah. Yeah. CFO, data guy. Like, he he wore a bunch of hats. You know? So this would be an opportunities for us to really kind of like, you know, all of these merge fields  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: those sorts of things. He's the one that  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: he's the one that coded this stuff. So even though within PandaDoc, we have some of these templates built out I still don't know, I'm sorry. I want to open the Internet. You know how they always have those random news stories.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Ray j claims he doesn't have long to live. I'm like, what? 2027 is a wrap. What? Like, what did you get yourself into now, AJ?  \nMe: That is now  \nThem: Your solutions.  \nMe: news.  \nThem: Yeah, man. Come on, man. Panda dark. I wish that upon him, but log in. But, yeah, just, you know, how to how to get that type of why is this why is this doing this? Other forms. Tax forms, NDAs, liability waivers, What what is this doing right now? That's so weird. AutomateFlow. Continue. This is really weird. Says logging me into PandaDoc for the first time. I would hope not.  \nMe: Wait. Sorry. I I sorry. Got was struck. I was reading something else.  \nThem: No. No. It's okay. As long as you didn't mess anything up, I'm alright. Just the the name of the name of our of our PANDA doctors look different. So what I was but like I said, my hope is to really get some of these mappings down for what these letters should look like.  \nMe: Yeah. That makes sense. Like, if we if we can have, like, a good example of, like, a before after, then it becomes easier to sort of, like, back into it. And if he if he can describe, like, sort of how he thought about the flow, how he thought about exceptions. Hold on. Because it seemed like he had some pretty complex, like, just, logic flow in that document if I just, at a glance, like, some I mean, I guess it's not particularly complex, but for word merge, anything with if else  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: like, is relatively calm.  \nThem: There's a lot going on. Like, you know, so whatever that pool looks like. Also, some of the things you might have in power automate, that so is Power Automate is is that, like, the the client side of the automation that feeds into AutomateFlow? Or AutomateFlow could  \nMe: Think you you could do it either way. So is it power automate is effect it's, like, is, like, Microsoft's workflow tool. So you could, like, trigger  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: you could have things in AutomateFlow trigger Power Automate steps, and you could have Power Automate steps trigger stuff in AutomateFlow, kind of either direction if that makes sense.  \nThem: It goes.  \nMe: Biggest the biggest, like, barrier we see for Power Automate in general is just the fact that it only connects to the Microsoft suite. So it's like, anytime you need to do the other. So, like, the, like, the PandaDoc, for example. Like, doesn't necessarily connect through Power Automate. That's like a  \nThem: Makes sense. That makes sense.  \nMe: if you were just honestly, if you were just using you know, all Microsoft stuff, like, if you were just using mail merge, for example, for this, like, Power Automate may be able to do that, but then you're losing a lot of the capabilities of, like, doc of a PandaDoc.  \nThem: That that completely makes sense. This is none of the stuff I need. There is I just wanna FlowBuilder he'll help help me walk through, but there's there is a client There I don't I'm just trying to FlowBuilder sure I still have access to the things that I need.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: There was something that I was I can't even think of the name of the software. But there was a software that I was using to remote into the servers.  \nMe: What VPN or something like that? And this is a  \nThem: I don't see it right now. Yeah. So I think we might need that to actually see what those flows look like. You'd have to remind me. I don't know I remember. But, other than that, yeah, I'm I'm just kind of excited to get us some of what we're missing. I'm trying to think if there's anything else.  \nMe: Actually, real quick while we're waiting.  \nThem: Corey.  \nMe: It's our it's sorry. Cody or Corey? Corey. While we're waiting for Corey, one wanted to get pick your brain on how we're thinking about timeline to go live here. High level, what I would like to propose and let me know whether, like, how realistic this is. We, over the next couple of weeks, get the CLS to PandaDoc sort of, like, fully running. Like, this this whole workflow, have the solution architect figure out, like, the webhook piece. And then we also and and then maybe one other one. I was thinking, at least initially, what we heard  \nThem: Sadie?  \nMe: from from Sadie.  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: And so if we, like, build those to demonstrate, like, hey. This works. This is how, like, the workflow is. Then get mister Eastpoint the references that he that we can find for that would be good customers there. And if we can, like, validate those things, validate the ROI, aiming for, like, sort of February to, like, have a, contract signed, and then we could have and that would be with those two use cases live. And then over the next you know, sixty days, we would work out, like, how do we flow out the rest of the use cases. I guess, yeah, just wanna does that feel reasonable at all? And I guess the biggest, roadblock there, I guess. I don't remember where roadblocks in the word, but, biggest limiting factor we have to be have figure out is, like, what what would it take for mister Eastpoint to be like, yes. I'm willing to to FlowBuilder this investment or, like, yes. This makes sense for us to move forward.  \nThem: Not in a brash way, but just say, hey. This this is this is our tool. You know what I mean? Like and I feel like it is, but  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I also don't wanna say this is our tool, and I don't know how much of the tool we need to buy upfront.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know what I mean? Like, PandaDoc was my recommendation. So I brought it to Tricia. She did the sign off on it, but it was more of a take the reins and FlowBuilder it work. You know what I mean? So so I I I don't I I I foresee February February definitely being obtainable. You know? I would love to see certain pieces move a little quicker, but it's gonna be iterations. I it's very aggressive on our end. So I I think your your timeline is very well in mind, and I don't I don't foresee sign off being too challenging either. So  \nMe: Makes sense. And okay. We can work on the actual specifics. I can share like, a proposal with you that we can work through over the next couple weeks, but  \nThem: Thank you.  \nMe: sounds good.  \nThem: Hey, Corey. Hey. How's it going? Nice to e meet you.  \nMe: Hi, Corey.  \nThem: I've heard all the great things. Nice to meet you guys. Sorry, man. I hate to beat you up a little bit further at the end of a long day. Oh, yeah. No worries at all. Let's see. Are you Are you still in the are you in finance, or are you in tech? What are you what are you into these days? No. Yeah. I'm in I'm in finance. I do I may, corporate controller. For oil and gas company.  \nMe: Very cool.  \nThem: Nice. Nice. Congratulations, man. That's a step up quite a step above. Yeah. Thank you. Man. Yeah. Nice. Well, this is Alex. Alex's with AutomateFlow. Just to give you some some backstory about kind of where we are and why I wanted to pull you in, We have gotten the the initial phase of efiling outweigh kind of I guess, as you've already aware, you know, all the courts had to go over to efiling and in a hour effort to avoid from pending signing and scanning back in. We started using a software called PandaDoc. That is allowing us to move signed documents back and forth electronically add signatures, and then get them out the door to provide it to actually electronically file for us. The component that's missing right now is getting what I would like to see high high, like, I don't know if it's possible, but being able to hit the button or whatever the word merge function is in CLS and have it populate the document in PandaDoc. And the the reason why we're kind of, like, reaching out kind of I don't wanna say independently of Justin, but just to kinda, like, focus on this is just so I I can have some time to really focus on, like, what it what it what feeds these templates? You know, what do those connections look like? What does it take to kinda fill some of this in? I mean, I I I know what the templates looks like, but in the sense of you know, like, what's what's feeding these different fields. This is PandaDoc, by the way. So we started, like, recreating the templates in PandaDoc. But what are the fields that actually feed these these merges? Like, I've seen some of the b b scripts that run-in the background. But I I don't know if we wrote those. I didn't know if, you know, that's only way that it happens. But I have Alex on because AutomateFlow would be our interfacing tool to, you know, feed that dot feed that information from CLS via API, over to over to PandaDoc to to to replicate that output, if that makes sense. Okay. Sure. That was a lot. Sorry. No. It's it's okay. Yeah. So, I I mean, I didn't write any this stuff. Like, all this was in place before I got there. I had to figure out you know, the bolts nuts and bolts of it, if you over my time there. Just because we had some turnover and everything. But I do I've feel like I could walk you through it. So, I mean, to put it simply, like, you know, when you look at this template, you see merge field eight sixty six seventy four blah blah blah. Whenever you merge a document in the CLS, it it spits out a text file and kinda labels them. And puts that into your p drive And so the script runs, and it takes the text drive and pushes those fields into the spots on the template. Is kind of overall process of it K. So yeah, I guess if you see that WP scripts if you open up, that's the first one that runs. Guess I should've run it open it to edit, not to run. Sorry. Yeah. I know this. Sorry. I James click happy there. I guess Notepad plus plus probably would have been a better tool. Hold on.  \nMe: Okay. Username.  \nThem: K.  \nMe: Merge data username. Okay. So this would be under the under merge data folder on and is this still in the p drive  \nThem: Or is this Yeah. There's part of it in the on your computer, the merge data folder? So yeah, I guess, on your own c drive,  \nMe: Oh, okay. This is just like this just says local user. Not it's not like it's just, like, on your computer in your c drive under gotcha. So, like, one of the lawyers would run this on their own com  \nThem: Oops. Sorry.  \nMe: computer, would run on their own device. So it would  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. And but there's something  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: there's something that goes above it. There's, like, a PowerShell script. That copies, like, all the templates or looks for changes in the templates in the template folder that I'm sure you're aware of, Charles, and then it copies those onto your c drive. So that's where  \nMe: In  \nThem: that's why it's directing to look there.  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: I can send these templates. Hold on. Let me do this. Yeah. Maybe let's see. If you go to Word, for a second, I can show you where it does that. And then, developer, I think, We understand it's been a while, so don't yeah. Visual basic. Yeah. Over there. And then Now some of this I was trying to go through, but I wasn't really where I was kind of just poking around. Where is Yeah. This doesn't look like what I was looking for though. I'm trying to remember how to get there. Yeah. That's what I was looking for. So, see, this is the part that I was talking about where it takes the template, and then it it moves it all into the into your  \nMe: Gotcha. And then runs that bash  \nThem: C drive.  \nMe: file, at the end, I assume, or something like that.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: I could send some of this to your agent.  \nMe: Could you could you talk a bit about just, like, so what what would the flow be for a lawyer to, like, FlowBuilder to, like, create this? Is is it, like, they would have sent sent this all to a folder, then, like, you would run this once a week, or is it, they would run it individually? Like, how how did this, like, process flow work when you were doing it?  \nThem: They, yeah, they run it individually. So if if you go into CLS, I could kinda walk you through it. And then just if you wanna go and file 92, I think that's the test file. Yeah. Okay. 92 or 93. I think they're both the same. Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: So, yeah, I mean, they're coming in here, and then I hear it too many times. I do that every time. Sorry. CLS is terrible. The bills on cobalt, man. What do you expect?  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: So we would come here One thing you should know, I'm F three And then, maybe do, like, d c l l t r d Or, actually, I don't know. That one may have some scripts on it. Maybe do, like, DGF PIF, and MD. That one, you can run no matter what.  \nMe: Are those, like, just are those templates examples?  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. It's just the the code.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: PIFMD. And hit okay? Or Yeah. So okay. I'll pick your enter again. You just do, like, one one per cord and debtor.  \nMe: And this would be like, okay, the lawyer they would actually wanna go through and, like, like, find the the specific person. Right, here, the specific court, I imagine.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. It's very specific here, and  \nMe: Okay. That makes sense.  \nThem: this is a pretty simple one. Like, some of them are have, like, complicated because it's reading from that to generate, like, the text file a lot of times.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: That it's using. Or all the time. Go ahead and enter. Yeah. Yeah. Just enter enter. Put whatever you want there.  \nMe: See towns.  \nThem: Imbalance.  \nMe: This is also I FlowBuilder I I'm starting to, like, build the connections between these and the fields and the list Like, this is how we get to, like, 80 fields. Right? Because, like,  \nThem: Sorry.  \nMe: they're nested. Here, like, and stuff.  \nThem: Probably shouldn't be recording this from the beginning. Sorry. Alright. Yeah. That was those added values you were saying.  \nMe: Okay. And then  \nThem: Okay. Yep. Yeah. Okay. And then now you can exit out. One more. Yeah. I'll take one more. Maybe two more, actually. Merge. And then, yeah, merge. It's like  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: so if you oh, I should've told you. Never mind. Uh-uh. Sorry.  \nMe: And then okay. And then this is the script that you were okay.  \nThem: And then, yeah, now the little error thing at top is Oh, yeah. Sorry. Runs that visual basic script. Is it because of the oh, yeah. This one here. But, yeah, if you wanna wait a second Mhmm. If you go in your P Drive now, we should be able to see that text file that I'm talking about. So, yeah, it's that one that says mask w p. If you open that one with  \nMe: He  \nThem: Notepad plus plus. So that's where it's getting the data from.  \nMe: Makes sense. Okay. So it's Okay. So this it's just like a flat file when and I mean, like, the line number that it's, like, matching to. Or something like that.  \nThem: Yep. Yeah. I believe so. Okay. Let me see if I can just  \nMe: P Save the copy. Drink come back to it.  \nThem: Gotcha. So it's kinda really just filling in all the all the variables. Yep. Okay. Yeah. And then, like, your template, like, if you went to go look at the  \nMe: The word  \nThem: template, it's referencing, you know, whatever line. So if you needed to pull another line on that template, you could could kinda look right here. If you, you know, really needed to. Because some of them are some of them are standard, and then some of them are customizable based on each code.  \nMe: e Okay.  \nThem: Do you know where that I don't know if you need that. Do, like, all the like, the layouts for the codes are. The Any file or for which one? Yeah. So, like, the it kinda tells you, what number is which field for the templates.  \nMe: Oh, that  \nThem: No. That would be helpful.  \nMe: yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. So I could show you. It's in the CLS manual, in the CLS. So this is this is what you're saying about the fields that it's it's correlating to? Yep. Yeah. So, if you look at 80 or whatever one you want, it should be, like, that line item.  \nMe: Like, January, assume, is, like, the company name or something. This is a girl.  \nThem: Okay. So 61 would actually be the date field on 17. So 61 is yeah. So, like, 61, that's gonna be, like, remember how when you were filling out that code, we entered one?  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: That's what it was looking for there. Okay.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: So you were saying if I go back to CLS? Yeah. I could show you. So, yeah, if you go to CLS and then click help, and then help manuals. Inkits and shit. I think it's in 9.1.  \nMe: Sorry.  \nThem: Manual. I think it would be in there.  \nMe: The I saw the drop down. I can't take it anymore. Yeah.  \nThem: Thing here is crazy, man. Maybe search. Word merge. One of the things I just had favor, dude. I I really don't  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: remember. Cool. So let's see. So, yeah, it's that field code list by number.  \nMe: Oh, right below right below the one you're currently on.  \nThem: That's the right thing. Got it.  \nMe: Oh, great. It's perfect. Okay. Okay. This is super helpful. So can I let me can I just play back how my sort of understanding of the of the flow right now? So the lawyers working CLS, they'll have a specific like, specific, like, that or, I guess, that they'll need that they're looking at. They'll fill in those forms. They James run, press that button at the front of the CLS that James, like, generate the Word document, and then they James press the button in the Word document to, like, actually run the run the script to, like, fill it in. But they they're they're not necessarily concerned about, like, the how it works in the  \nThem: Right.  \nMe: back end, but that's, like, their flow. Today.  \nThem: Right.  \nMe: And, question. Just in terms of, like, how much judgment is involved in those steps? So, like, is is could we like, is there is there a reason that the that the, like, things that the lawyer is checking as they're filling this in? Or is it, like, moving from one like place to another if that makes sense?  \nThem: No. Yeah. I I get where you're going for. I'd say it depends, like, specific but the majority of the time, majority of the time, they're you know, they just got off a call. They okay. Let me send this guy a balance letter. I mean, I guess if you wanted to to queue up something like that, but yeah, majority of the time, they're they need to look like they're sending a letter on a garnishment, they have to know who is active or who they're sending the letter to because they could have, like, yeah. It depends on the situation, I guess. I mean, there could be times where they're doing this, like, pretty much systematically. Like,  \nMe: And  \nThem: you know, when they're filing suit, the team in India, was handling that when I was there. It's pretty much just list and file mean, there are checks they have to do before they do it.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But then once it gets to the point of I need to merge this document, it's okay. Do it for on this list of accounts.  \nMe: Okay. So there might be some opportunities to standardize, but there are likely still things where, like, hey. We actually need a human's perspective to look at this and, like, and FlowBuilder FlowBuilder some judgment calls. That makes sense?  \nThem: Yeah. I would think so. It's so new to me. I'm sorry. Just poking around while y'all were talking. Like, it's just it's interesting. Like, there is quite a bit that is here.  \nMe: Yeah. This  \nThem: Like I said, knowing where to pull it from.  \nMe: yeah. I feel like this is a this is a treasure trove of just, like, data source of, like, information that we can use to build off of here.  \nThem: Do you with the did you have any any input on building out these templates in Word? Or, like you said, you kind of just inherited a lot of a lot of these already? I mean, I did inherit It was all built, but I'd I had had to maintain it for a period of time. So, I mean, I I do kinda know how they work.  \nMe: I guess this is this is kind of a broad question. But just, like, you did this process for a very long time. Obviously, both Charles and I are, like, rel I'm even newer. Charles is, like, sort of the the spots Is there are there just are there any questions we should be asking that we aren't?  \nThem: No.  \nMe: I guess it's like a a broad question, but, like, just based on your experience doing this, anything that we're  \nThem: What about it?  \nMe: like, missing if we're gonna if we're gonna go try rebuild this using a different  \nThem: Oh,  \nMe: tools or things we need to  \nThem: what are they doing?  \nMe: really FlowBuilder sure we keep in mind.  \nThem: I guess what would be the reason behind wanting to rebuild the entire templates themselves? Like, it seems like all you guys need to do is get the Word document into PDF, into your your flow or your, you know, your business process automation tool. So, like, why would you wanna take on rebuilding the entire stuff that's already there? Because I think it when you're gonna get into that, you're gonna get into really complex, like, ifs statements on each of these templates.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like, these are these are very, like, I don't know, like, user specific templates. It seems like you could just I don't know. I mean, I I don't know what your software does.  \nMe: I mean so we don't our AutomateFlow is just a not just it's it's sort of like the data pipeline between different tools. It's a it's a general business automation tool. And the reason we were I think, even starting this Charles, let me know if I'm misspeaking here, but if we're moving to a world where the documents are signed in PandaDoc, we want to just, like, reduce the amount of steps that, the lawyers have to take. So, like, right now, they would have to, do this, download it, then separately upload the PandaDoc, and then track it there and then pull it down again. I think our our goal is just to, like, minimize the steps between and and and to your point, maybe it is, like, the step isn't after like, when they do the templates, maybe the step is they upload the template or, like, the template gets created and we pull that. But we just needed to, I think, understand how the flow was done before we could even see what was reasonable here. But we just there I think there was just so much we didn't even know. Around it. To be transparent.  \nThem: So no. That's complete, I think, on par. And that was a good question. I'm sorry. They were telling me that the that I'm the last person here, they were telling me that the alarm is not working. So I kinda missed the beginning of what you were saying, Corey, but it almost sounded like you were saying why we wanna take on this task when it's already built out? Is that fair? I mean, in a nutshell. I I just think you're I I was saying, I guess, like, to me, it seems like you could take, like, the, you know, results are already being generated and what's working and then push that into PDF with, like, a script or something at the end of that Visual Basic script and then get it into your work instead of trying to recreate the whole template process. Okay. That's fair. When you get into those templates, you they're you're there's very, like, a lot of specific things on mean, it's all just fields, right, at the end of the day, but  \nMe: You're introduced  \nThem: there's a lot of in those A lot of if statements on the  \nMe: so wrong.  \nThem: word document itself. Yeah. We've gotten way more intimate than I would have ever cared to, honestly. Like, just since because our initial thought was that we would have to recreate the templates just to get it to even be able to pass around to sign. But when after doing some research and I came across PandaDoc, it was we were able to kind of, like, just drop them in. Right? So in during that research phase, it really just became, like, a alright. What does that even look like? And I think this is last one I did. So, you know, it really just became a a process of, like, understanding what they are, understanding what the name of the conventions are, understanding, like, this is why that you know, some of these documents get created that way. Like, some of them are just scripts only. So, yeah, you're right. Like, there's a lot of, like, if then, and you've seen all of these. Right? So it it just really became an intimate, like, this is what it takes to build these out. If statements. And I didn't know if those were CLS dependent or if it was, like, word merge dependent about you know, why some of those some of this logic would exist on the back end that would like, you know, if it's a 6,500, if it's a you know, depending upon who the client is, know, then it generates something a little bit different. So you're right. It it does get very intricate about that that piece of it all. Yeah. Yeah. And the scripts there's, like, logic, CLS scripts, in itself on those on the specific codes inside CLS. That are like, hey. If you're trying to do this on this type of account, it's not gonna let you. There's kinda, like, user fail proof safe stuff in there too. That's helpful. That's helpful. So, you know, they might put in this DCLL TRMD, but not only does it trigger a document to be produced, but and then it looks at, you know, all of the other factors. It also, like you said, adds those fail safes into CLS to say, hey. These are some of the automations or these are some of you know, it's kicking off other things in CLS as well. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, yeah, if they go to do I I can't remember exactly one of maybe, like, the dispute. Like, if someone enters a dispute, in CLS, there's something else that's sending an email notification to the proper parties and client service that need to be notified of that. Things like that. And that was was that CLS specific, or do you think someone here built it out to have those types of triggers? It's it's a function within CLS. Okay. Do you think it would be worth having a conversation with Vertican to see, like, this is what we were thinking. Yes. No. Maybe. It is. I mean, it could be worth having the conversation, but I James tell you, like, there's a lot of customized functions when with how your word merge is working compared to how they intended to work. And they don't like that. And they're, you know, I don't know, not very helpful. Got it. So so the customizations, were were those just things that think we just kept adding over time? I think it I I'm guessing it was done. I really don't know because it was kinda there before my time, but I'm guessing it was done because we needed ours we needed the logic on those templates to be a little more sophisticated than they were coming out to be. And so I'm assuming that's why they did that.  \nMe: You know?  \nThem: So is this, like, Dustin error, Wes error, or a combination of both? I think this was, like, Vince. Like, Oh, wow. Back in that time. Okay. He's a while. Yeah. Okay. No. This is I mean, this is helpful, though.  \nMe: You know? I think this is yeah.  \nThem: Because this is you know, even if even knowing, you know, what what some of this is kind of built off of and just what's there. Helps Alex and I have the conversation around what gets moved, how it gets moved. Like you said, is it is it a matter of instead of me building out these exact templates in PandaDoc, and trying to add the logic to it, do we just ingest these? So right now, when someone drops something into PandaDoc this is this is PandaDoc. Someone dropped this in I kinda wanna mess with this one. Hold on. Let me see if I can FlowBuilder a copy of it. Sorry. Okay. Copy. And then I can move this. Alright. So documents. All documents. Just kinda give you an idea of what goes on here. Right? So somebody added this signature box in. So we'll drag and drop a signature box I can assign it to myself, and then I have a signature that's already stored. Except and signed. The ideal so once I sign it or once I've I've I've fill in or do whatever I needed to do to this document, we can also the notaries also have the option to save their stamp. They would just add their stamp in and, you know, so all of that is within the document. So once that is completed, I would go then take the same document Even though it's in the sandbox, I would then take this document and move it either to hearing to to where the attorneys can then sign off on it. Move it from hearing then to the cost bin to where, you know, now it's it's it's ready for accounting to add any type of whatever they need to add to it. Legal account managers, they still have different queues that they're working. So, you know, it's it's got all of the it's got all of the same looks and feels of moving the paper document from place to place. But it's all on on in a in a legal I mean, not legal. In electronic format to where we're just moving it around from space to from space to space here. I don't know if I did that. I don't know. I don't know why it's there. Whatever. But so that's kind of where we are. It's if we can actually have the document populate into PandaDoc we can create a workflow to where this document now it's here. Once Alex signs off on it, then it goes to the next bin, and it automatically moves from person to person. On top of that, once they once they get it and the document's been completed in a sense and not in a draft status, all they're going to it and doing is kind of like what you might see in, like, a DocuSign or any other document. So instead of them having to drag and drop the signature field, when they receive it, they're just going click add their signature. It would automatically go to the next line. Click. It adds their signature. And then now once they're done with it, it automatically moves itself to the next person They're on to the next document. So that's kind of why we're trying to add it into PandaDoc. And not just drag and drop it. It's working right now. I mean, there's some grumblings about how it's working, but we also know, like, we have to do it. You know? Right. And we're since we're the largest filer, the the the whole know, we were on we were on a call with Trek, ironically, And, you know, I was talking to Joe, and he was asking about, you know, what our progress looks like to ESON. And, and or, rather. And I told him, you know, with us being the state's largest filer, you know, it's it's an adjustment. While I'm saying that, he's looking up the numbers. We have 21,000 placements in the state with track. Out of those 21,000, 17,000 of them are hours. The next closest one has 2,100. The next one closest underneath that is 1,600. So, you know, I explained to him about a twenty working days a month, if you get 10 of 10 of these a a day, then, yeah, you can still sign, print, sign, scan, and and back in. It won't be an impact. If you have 70 to 80 of these to do a day, on a on a regular slow day, then it becomes an issue. So that like, to answer the question, it's it's only for, like, ease of operation. Are we working right now? Yeah. It's working. Are are they getting better? Yeah. Just cause people are getting used to the process. But I'm glad you're being very in saying that this is a big undertaking. You know? Just be aware of all of the nuances. So I definitely appreciate you sharing that. But this is that's just kinda giving, like, a 5,000 foot view of, like, this is where we would like to go and this is why. It's not just, like, a nice to have in the sense of you know, it it's just very manual. Kinda tedious. And if there's a if there's an issue with the know, if somebody moved it to the wrong place, you know, it's a just a lot of human interaction with it, having to FlowBuilder sure the signature is in the right place. That helps sorts of things. But, I don't know if that helped. I'm sorry. I don't I wanna overtalk you at the end the No. That makes sense. I mean, yeah, I get I get I just think with all the logic inside CLS itself, you know, you're gonna be prone to errors for sure.  \nMe: No.  \nThem: That's I'm trying to think so how do they so they how do they get it in here now? So they they merge it, and what are they doing? Just drag and drop and like, you would just go here, create a new you know, you find a local file, See, these are the some of the templates we already created so they can, like, just easily it would just be there. But right now, they would literally just they're going to how do you get your your data in PandaDoc? Though, like, to pull from the template That's where  \nMe: This is the templates already made. Right? Like, least today, they're still doing that first part in CLS. Right? I might think  \nThem: Right. Exactly. So we're not gonna cut out sales. We can't. Like, I'm not gonna lie. Like, CLS is here to stay. So the CLS, that's what we were thinking. The word merge would actually pass that data into the same fields. That it would have populated them in in a Word document. But instead of populating in a Word document, in a populated Yeah. It's pushing Yeah. Yeah. No. I mean, that could work. Because yeah. I mean, the the text file yeah. I don't know. Because the the I mean, you know, the text file James have the the stuff in the fields.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I just don't know at what point does that happen. Does it you know, when I guess it just had to be at the end of the script. Just push push the stuff in there.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. And that was that's kind of where we were thinking. It's just like a alright. Is it is it a a a edit to the visual basic? Is it, you know, that sort of a thing? But to answer your other question, now that's this is how they do it. They just literally just pick a pick a file, pick a document, drag and drop it, start adding the signatures where they are. Pretty much every person that touches it like, know, once they go through the legal review, the lambs do, then they'll they'll add their signature, their, you know, their, initial. That's the word I'm looking for. Add their initial, then they'll drop it in the box for hearing. Then the attorneys James come in and add their signatures and then add their stamp. And then they'll put in the cost bin to be sent out, for Provana to e file. And, ideally, we would actually be able to have provoked that that that push from accounting straight to, like, a s SFTP to Provana's iPerform which is the name of their e filing comp component. For iPerform to just pick that up from a f SFTP side as well. So, but, yeah, that that's the sum. Yeah. So that's that's the thought, though, is if So we like to go, like like, what like, yeah, like, I get what you're saying. Just right after they merge it, just take it.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But but why couldn't he just take the so, like okay. So maybe if you go into the file explorer and you go into the f drive, Let's You said f? Yeah. F CLS Inc, output I don't know. Okay. Users, and then maybe let's just let's choose Alex. And Noel. Anymore of them? That's weird. Okay. Maybe choose, like, a current LAM. I don't know. Valerie or Teresa or somebody. Williams? Yeah. That should be right. It's so weird, man. Like, I've been asking them, like, some of these some of this stuff just doesn't seem like it's I being used. Right? Like, That's really weird. Sadie doesn't do it. Valerie's  \nMe: The one s PAMA, there's an update on  \nThem: Oh, you're looking at the date?  \nMe: January 2, please.  \nThem: Yeah. Let's do this. Alright. And That's really because they're accounting. Yeah. Like, you're I don't understand why you're LAM Maybe I'm may maybe I can go in someone, FlowBuilder sure I'm in the right folder even. It has been a while. That's okay.  \nMe: Yeah. How how dare you not memorize all of this very Right. Like,  \nThem: Maybe go back. On your arm like a quarterback. Like, you know Could you go back one more? Yeah. Swore that's the right place, though. But there's a folder where it saves everyone's, like, Word documents that are produced Swore it was output users. Export. The best word? No. That's what we mean. I think it's yeah. I'm not seeing anything. Alright. Either Go maybe go back in that output folder. Maybe just go to, like, one of the people in that output folder. Okay. Sort this one. Yeah. See, that's what I would expect. '26 and then January.  \nMe: Wonder if they're just all going through pravana now. That might like, by default, like everyone so they're you the actual lawyers not going into the, like, lawyer's files. They they all just route through Pirvana.  \nThem: Wait. I think  \nMe: That because that's the the  \nThem: I I'm in the wrong  \nMe: team I've been  \nThem: I'm in the wrong folder, guys. Sorry. It's okay. Go to the go to in drive. My bad. This is kinda coming back now. Okay. Now it's just fine. An LAM here. Alex again? Yeah. I think if he does documents daily, that should work.  \nMe: Accounting info. Eckert. Docs.  \nThem: No. Shit. No. Sorry. Yeah. This is not somebody somebody knows what I'm talking about. Though. I can't remember where this folder is. But, like, there's a folder somewhere where it has every document that they produce for that day and it's, like, inside a folder with the date. So it's almost like if you could be a day behind and just take, like, the previous day Word documents that were generated and then automatically flow those into your, process flow. I think I've seen SAIDI open that folder for sure before. I can't think of what it was. I think you're right. Maybe x merge. Is it that? Is that really? Is Yeah. This is it. Yeah. Yeah. Because it it's in that script, actually. Yeah. After it's all  \nMe: And, like, have, like, a today update too.  \nThem: Right. So, yeah, that one's a little different because she's, South Carolina. So so she's got that that printed folder. But, yeah, like, someone else  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: Yeah. See how it's, like, date specifics? Every single day. Yeah. You could be a day behind and just take the next one. Put it into their queue, the you know, for the LAM. And then once the LAM signs it off, it goes to the attorney and then, you know, wherever else it needs to go after that. I see what you're saying. You don't have to try to mess with the templates. You don't have to worry about potentially sending you know, personal information over to, like, a third party company or anything. You're just sending the the document that is gonna be filed in the public record anyway. No. You're right on about that one because that that's definitely some of the stuff that's come up before. So everything's already populated. That sort of a thing.  \nMe: No? Okay.  \nThem: You think Alex, you think this is something that can be picked up?  \nMe: Definitely, right? Because this a SharePoint folder, I assume. Like, the back end or something like that. We can you can set up triggers so that, hey. Check check this once a day. Look for the folders with that name that we're looking for. Of course, like, with any kind of stuff like this, the devil's in the details in terms of, like, how once you actually get the connection. But in theory, there's no reason this shouldn't be very doable.  \nThem: It did something. There it is. Now you're right. It is so it's the merge folder for sure.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: So we did that they're in. Oh, no. It's not. Not weird at all. They're still working stuff from December.  \nMe: He  \nThem: Shit. Sucks, man. Boy. So we switched over to e filing, on the first, like, you know, the stuff towards the December, we couldn't actually do anything with it. Because we knew the courts would get it because they were closed for the holidays. So it kinda it kinda works itself out to where  \nMe: He  \nThem: just like, alright. Well, these are some of the things we just have to kinda have to deal with. But like I said, majority of the fields are already populated, the dates. The amounts,  \nMe: Like, I think don't know if this is reasonable, but if it if all the lawyer has to do is fill out the CLS, and then after that, like, we can figure out how to drop it in, they get, like, an alert of, okay. It's in DocuSign. Now, like, update. I think that would be the ideal flow here. And then that could we could keep the, like,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: generation  \nThem: Yeah. I agree.  \nMe: and, like, trigger that automatically without sort of, like, rewriting the entire thing necessarily.  \nThem: I mean, that could definitely be and at this point, I don't think anyone's concerned about is it right? Like, are we missing anything? Do we have to do run-in tandem to say that these fields might not be the right field? You know, that that's been one of the larger concerns is, like, how do we know the amounts are right? How do we know, you know, that it's producing the right the right output which is very valid, but I was just gonna we're just gonna have to run it and and test it for a while. Like, that's all we can do. But at this point, if we're just picking up the document that's already prepopulated with all of the things, then we're just I should say that Alex is almost kind of, like, thinking through, alright. So at this point, who does it go to? What do we need to add? Is this a signature field? You know? Attorney review type of sign, a kickback Lam review? You know, what does that look like? I mean, this one's a demand letter so no attorney actually sees it. But,  \nMe: But in general, yeah. But  \nThem: yeah.  \nMe: yeah.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay. This is great. Corey, super appreciate you, spending the time with us. This is, I think, really helpful.  \nThem: You know, Definitely been helpful, man. I appreciate it. Yeah. No problem at all. I wanna take some time at some point to go through some of these automations. I don't know when would be a good time I don't wanna over overwhelm you on this on the same call. But so I got this from Sadie. And these aren't all happening the way that they need to. I'm trying to get it to I don't know why it's only showing this top hat. Oh, I think because it's I opened it in mail instead of but so, you know, they're missing direct pays. They're missing POE stuff. So that was her biggest thing is understanding with these automations. And I think that's really why I would I've been asking about, the automation so much is because they're not working the way that they had been designed, and I didn't know which your here we go. I didn't know which your, involvement was in the creation of some of these. Because if they haven't been touched since you left, it's time that they need to be. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's definitely, you know, maintenance and upkeep on those for sure. So if no one is, like, watching the automation and making sure that there's no issues every day, then there's a 100% gonna be problems. Right? Like, someone has to be monitoring the logs daily. And if something doesn't fire off, you have to manually fire it off. You know, that's definitely gonna be an issue. And so power automate or It's a little bit of both. So most of them task scheduler, kicks off something inside, power automate. But sometimes task schedulers kicking off CLS to generate files because you know, the files that are going to the clients and then it's gotta kick off CLS to import the files that so, I mean, I mean, there could be you know, that's what I'm saying. Like, really, if if no one's, like, why watching the logs daily, then, like, you're gonna have issues no matter what because the client's FTP could have been down when he tried to download that file. And then I mean, it should have downloaded it the next time, but then it could've got hung up on the automation server. Sometimes the automation server itself just gets hung up, and you gotta kinda with CLS, I'm sure you've seen it. Like, when you're importing a file, just sometimes weird box pops up, and you can't really write that into your script to close this weird box. Down. You just you gotta jump on the automation server and close that down, and then it finishes And so it's if I had to guess, it's probably that, like, people like, something's getting hung up. Nobody's getting to close it down that day. And then days and days are kinda building up. Makes sense. Trying to think of the Midland one specifically or the v exchange one. This one was a little Like, finicky, I think. But, yeah, I mean, do you have the automation server I could kinda give you, like, a rundown there. I do. How are you on time? Both of you, actually.  \nMe: I actually do need to to drop, unfortunately.  \nThem: Okay. No. I I kinda thought.  \nMe: But  \nThem: So what I'll do is, Corey, do you you have do you mind scheduling another time? Or or were you still Yeah. No. So you're still doing set? He does Saturdays at nine with us. He's on a schedule. I don't know if Alex if that's ever a time they could work for you. Are these e  \nMe: Saturday at nine? I could actually I could do that. I can join.  \nThem: okay. So I don't know. I'm gonna get with Angel and Shelley and see if they had something scheduled. But since you already have that on your calendar, if that works better for you, Corey, then maybe we can, you know, get one of those in and really kinda go through these automations and and just see if it's something that AutomateFlow can help. And even if AutomateFlow does nothing else but send us an alert that said, hey. This failed.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: That's a win for us. You know? But I feel like AutomateFlow could definitely kind of replace or  \nMe: Okay. I mean,  \nThem: you know, just kind of help help help move this on.  \nMe: I well, yeah, with with stuff like this, it's it's you guys have been running for so long with their like, the processes. It's like it's almost think, Corey, what you're getting at earlier sometimes, like, making an update somewhere can actually just FlowBuilder things worse. And, you know, if we can put visibility to it, maybe that's enough for it to be worthwhile and valuable. Or you know, honestly, there's a world in which we go through this, we do this work, we do discovery, and it's actually like, hey, you know, there's not as much, need for it as we thought because of, like, the way that the systems are currently set  \nThem: That's good.  \nMe: up. And so that that could be the answer.  \nThem: That's good. Yeah. I mean, there's probably maybe a little little bit of both too. Right? But yeah. Well, Saturday night works for me. For sure.  \nMe: Mhmm.  \nThem: Well, thank you for your time, man. Like, this this gave us a lot to kind of digest, especially the fact that, hey. Maybe it's there. We're just pulling in. You know? Like, that if that's the if that's the solution, I'm okay with that. Like, just because it it's it is a lot of logic that's there. But, you know, if there's if if we have to touch it and have to move it around, at least, you know, you gave us a lot of great reference points. It's kind of at least start the conversation. Pawn e seven two e five. So I agree. Yeah. I think if I were, yeah, if I were you guys, I mean, I think you're gonna save yourself a lot of time and headaches if you could just get that end output to go right into your flow. You know?  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Sounds good. Yeah.  \nMe: Awesome.  \nThem: Thank y'all both. I'll let you get have the rest of your evening. I'm gonna get out to the office.  \nMe: Alright. It was great to meet you, Charles. We James talk Saturday.  \nThem: Yeah. Nice meeting you.  \nMe: Bye, guys. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/40af1bb2-6ca4-4b4b-beed-2c13b0bc0d24](https://example.com/...

Just to give you some some backstory about kind of where we are and why I wanted to pull you in, We have gotten the the initial phase of efiling outweigh kind of I guess, as you've already aware, you know, all the courts had to go over to efiling and in a hour effort to avoid from pending signing and scanning back in. We started using a software called PandaDoc. That is allowing us to move signed documents back and forth electronically add signatures, and then get them out the door to provide it to actually electronically file for us. The component that's missing right now is getting what I would like to see high high, like, I don't know if it's possible, but being able to hit the button or whatever the word merge function is in CLS and have it populate the document in PandaDoc. And the the reason why we're kind of, like, reaching out kind of I don't wanna say independently of Justin, but just to kinda, like, focus on this is just so I I can have some time to really focus on, like, what it what it what feeds these templates? You know, what do those connections look like? What does it take to kinda fill some of this in? I mean, I I I know what the templates looks like, but in the sense of you know, like, what's what's feeding these different fields. This is PandaDoc, by the way. So we started, like, recreating the templates in PandaDoc. But what are the fields that actually feed these these merges? Like, I've seen some of the b b scripts that run-in the background. But I I don't know if we wrote those. I didn't know if, you know, that's only way that it happens. But I have Alex on because AutomateFlow would be our interfacing tool to, you know, feed that dot feed that information from CLS via API, over to over to PandaDoc to to to replicate that output, if that makes sense. Okay. Sure. That was a lot. Sorry. No. It's it's okay. Yeah. So, I I mean, I didn't write any this stuff. Like, all this was in place before I got there. I had to figure out you know, the bolts nuts and bolts of it, if you over my time there. Just because we had some turnover and everything. But I do I've feel like I could walk you through it. So, I mean, to put it simply, like, you know, when you look at this template, you see merge field eight sixty six seventy four blah blah blah. Whenever you merge a document in the CLS, it it spits out a text file and kinda labels them. And puts that into your p drive And so the script runs, and it takes the text drive and pushes those fields into the spots on the template. Is kind of overall process of it K. So yeah, I guess if you see that WP scripts if you open up, that's the first one that runs. Guess I should've run it open it to edit, not to run. Sorry. Yeah. I know this. Sorry. I James click happy there. I guess Notepad plus plus probably would have been a better tool. Hold on."

So, like, right now, they would have to, do this, download it, then separately upload the PandaDoc, and then track it there and then pull it down again. I think our our goal is just to, like, minimize the steps between and and and to your point, maybe it is, like, the step isn't after like, when they do the templates, maybe the step is they upload the template or, like, the template gets created and we pull that. But we just needed to, I think, understand how the flow was done before we could even see what was reasonable here. But we just there I think there was just so much we didn't even know. Around it.

I mean, in a nutshell. I I just think you're I I was saying, I guess, like, to me, it seems like you could take, like, the, you know, results are already being generated and what's working and then push that into PDF with, like, a script or something at the end of that Visual Basic script and then get it into your work instead of trying to recreate the whole template process.

Like, just since because our initial thought was that we would have to recreate the templates just to get it to even be able to pass around to sign. But when after doing some research and I came across PandaDoc, it was we were able to kind of, like, just drop them in. Right? So in during that research phase, it really just became, like, a alright. What does that even look like? And I think this is last one I did. So, you know, it really just became a a process of, like, understanding what they are, understanding what the name of the conventions are, understanding, like, this is why that you know, some of these documents get created that way. Like, some of them are just scripts only. So, yeah, you're right. Like, there's a lot of, like, if then, and you've seen all of these. Right? So it it just really became an intimate, like, this is what it takes to build these out. If statements. And I didn't know if those were CLS dependent or if it was, like, word merge dependent about you know, why some of those some of this logic would exist on the back end that would like, you know, if it's a 6,500, if it's a you know, depending upon who the client is, know, then it generates something a little bit different. So you're right. It it does get very intricate about that that piece of it all. Yeah. Yeah. And the scripts there's, like, logic, CLS scripts, in itself on those on the specific codes inside CLS. That are like, hey. If you're trying to do this on this type of account, it's not gonna let you. There's kinda, like, user fail proof safe stuff in there too. That's helpful. That's helpful. So, you know, they might put in this DCLL TRMD, but not only does it trigger a document to be produced, but and then it looks at, you know, all of the other factors. It also, like you said, adds those fail safes into CLS to say, hey. These are some of the automations or these are some of you know, it's kicking off other things in CLS as well. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, yeah, if they go to do I I can't remember exactly one of maybe, like, the dispute. Like, if someone enters a dispute, in CLS, there's something else that's sending an email notification to the proper parties and client service that need to be notified of that. Things like that. And that was was that CLS specific, or do you think someone here built it out to have those types of triggers? It's it's a function within CLS. Okay. Do you think it would be worth having a conversation with Vertican to see, like, this is what we were thinking. Yes. No. Maybe. It is. I mean, it could be worth having the conversation, but I James tell you, like, there's a lot of customized functions when with how your word merge is working compared to how they intended to work. And they don't like that. And they're, you know, I don't know, not very helpful. Got it. So so the customizations, were were those just things that think we just kept adding over time? I think it I I'm guessing it was done. I really don't know because it was kinda there before my time, but I'm guessing it was done because we needed ours we needed the logic on those templates to be a little more sophisticated than they were coming out to be. And so I'm assuming that's why they did that."

Helps Alex and I have the conversation around what gets moved, how it gets moved. Like you said, is it is it a matter of instead of me building out these exact templates in PandaDoc, and trying to add the logic to it, do we just ingest these? So right now, when someone drops something into PandaDoc this is this is PandaDoc. Someone dropped this in I kinda wanna mess with this one. Hold on. Let me see if I can FlowBuilder a copy of it. Sorry. Okay. Copy. And then I can move this. Alright. So documents. All documents. Just kinda give you an idea of what goes on here. Right? So somebody added this signature box in. So we'll drag and drop a signature box I can assign it to myself, and then I have a signature that's already stored. Except and signed. The ideal so once I sign it or once I've I've I've fill in or do whatever I needed to do to this document, we can also the notaries also have the option to save their stamp. They would just add their stamp in and, you know, so all of that is within the document. So once that is completed, I would go then take the same document Even though it's in the sandbox, I would then take this document and move it either to hearing to to where the attorneys can then sign off on it. Move it from hearing then to the cost bin to where, you know, now it's it's it's ready for accounting to add any type of whatever they need to add to it. Legal account managers, they still have different queues that they're working. So, you know, it's it's got all of the it's got all of the same looks and feels of moving the paper document from place to place. But it's all on on in a in a legal I mean, not legal. In electronic format to where we're just moving it around from space to from space to space here. I don't know if I did that. I don't know. I don't know why it's there. Whatever. But so that's kind of where we are. It's if we can actually have the document populate into PandaDoc we can create a workflow to where this document now it's here. Once Alex signs off on it, then it goes to the next bin, and it automatically moves from person to person. On top of that, once they once they get it and the document's been completed in a sense and not in a draft status, all they're going to it and doing is kind of like what you might see in, like, a DocuSign or any other document. So instead of them having to drag and drop the signature field, when they receive it, they're just going click add their signature. It would automatically go to the next line. Click. It adds their signature. And then now once they're done with it, it automatically moves itself to the next person They're on to the next document. So that's kind of why we're trying to add it into PandaDoc. And not just drag and drop it. It's working right now. I mean, there's some grumblings about how it's working, but we also know, like, we have to do it. You know? Right. And we're since we're the largest filer, the the the whole know, we were on we were on a call with Trek, ironically, And, you know, I was talking to Joe, and he was asking about, you know, what our progress looks like to ESON. And, and or, rather. And I told him, you know, with us being the state's largest filer, you know, it's it's an adjustment. While I'm saying that, he's looking up the numbers. We have 21,000 placements in the state with track. Out of those 21,000, 17,000 of them are hours. The next closest one has 2,100. The next one closest underneath that is 1,600. So, you know, I explained to him about a twenty working days a month, if you get 10 of 10 of these a a day, then, yeah, you can still sign, print, sign, scan, and and back in. It won't be an impact. If you have 70 to 80 of these to do a day, on a on a regular slow day, then it becomes an issue. So that like, to answer the question, it's it's only for, like, ease of operation. Are we working right now? Yeah. It's working. Are are they getting better? Yeah. Just cause people are getting used to the process. But I'm glad you're being very in saying that this is a big undertaking. You know? Just be aware of all of the nuances. So I definitely appreciate you sharing that. But this is that's just kinda giving, like, a 5,000 foot view of, like, this is where we would like to go and this is why. It's not just, like, a nice to have in the sense of you know, it it's just very manual. Kinda tedious. And if there's a if there's an issue with the know, if somebody moved it to the wrong place, you know, it's a just a lot of human interaction with it, having to FlowBuilder sure the signature is in the right place. That helps sorts of things. But, I don't know if that helped. I'm sorry. I don't I wanna overtalk you at the end the No. That makes sense. I mean, yeah, I get I get I just think with all the logic inside CLS itself, you know, you're gonna be prone to errors for sure."

Pretty much every person that touches it like, know, once they go through the legal review, the lambs do, then they'll they'll add their signature, their, you know, their, initial. That's the word I'm looking for. Add their initial, then they'll drop it in the box for hearing. Then the attorneys James come in and add their signatures and then add their stamp. And then they'll put in the cost bin to be sent out, for Provana to e file. And, ideally, we would actually be able to have provoked that that that push from accounting straight to, like, a s SFTP to Provana's iPerform which is the name of their e filing comp component. For iPerform to just pick that up from a f SFTP side as well. So, but, yeah, that that's the sum. Yeah.

I'm not seeing anything. Alright. Either Go maybe go back in that output folder. Maybe just go to, like, one of the people in that output folder. Okay. Sort this one. Yeah.

So it's almost like if you could be a day behind and just take, like, the previous day Word documents that were generated and then automatically flow those into your, process flow. I think I've seen SAIDI open that folder for sure before. I can't think of what it was. I think you're right. Maybe x merge. Is it that? Is that really? Is Yeah. This is it. Yeah. Yeah.

And then once the LAM signs it off, it goes to the attorney and then, you know, wherever else it needs to go after that. I see what you're saying. You don't have to try to mess with the templates. You don't have to worry about potentially sending you know, personal information over to, like, a third party company or anything. You're just sending the the document that is gonna be filed in the public record anyway. No. You're right on about that one because that that's definitely some of the stuff that's come up before.

Do we have to do run-in tandem to say that these fields might not be the right field? You know, that that's been one of the larger concerns is, like, how do we know the amounts are right? How do we know, you know, that it's producing the right the right output which is very valid, but I was just gonna we're just gonna have to run it and and test it for a while. Like, that's all we can do. But at this point, if we're just picking up the document that's already prepopulated with all of the things, then we're just I should say that Alex is almost kind of, like, thinking through, alright. So at this point, who does it go to? What do we need to add? Is this a signature field? You know? Attorney review type of sign, a kickback Lam review? You know, what does that look like? I mean, this one's a demand letter so no attorney actually sees it. But,"

          "text": "You know, Definitely been helpful, man. I appreciate it. Yeah. No problem at all. I wanna take some time at some point to go through some of these automations. I don't know when would be a good time I don't wanna over overwhelm you on this on the same call. But so I got this from Sadie. And these aren't all happening the way that they need to. I'm trying to get it to I don't know why it's only showing this top hat. Oh, I think because it's I opened it in mail instead of but so, you know, they're missing direct pays. They're missing POE stuff. So that was her biggest thing is understanding with these automations. And I think that's really why I would I've been asking about, the automation so much is because they're not working the way that they had been designed, and I didn't know which your here we go. I didn't know which your, involvement was in the creation of some of these. Because if they haven't been touched since you left, it's time that they need to be. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's definitely, you know, maintenance and upkeep on those for sure. So if no one is, like, watching the automation and making sure that there's no issues every day, then there's a 100% gonna be problems. Right? Like, someone has to be monitoring the logs daily. And if something doesn't fire off, you have to manually fire it off. You know, that's definitely gonna be an issue. And so power automate or It's a little bit of both. So most of them task scheduler, kicks off something inside, power automate. But sometimes task schedulers kicking off CLS to generate files because you know, the files that are going to the clients and then it's gotta kick off CLS to import the files that so, I mean, I mean, there could be you know, that's what I'm saying. Like, really, if if no one's, like, why watching the logs daily, then, like, you're gonna have issues no matter what because the client's FTP could have been down when he tried to download that file. And then I mean, it should have downloaded it the next time, but then it could've got hung up on the automation server. Sometimes the automation server itself just gets hung up, and you gotta kinda with CLS, I'm sure you've seen it. Like, when you're importing a file, just sometimes weird box pops up, and you can't really write that into your script to close this weird box. Down. You just you gotta jump on the automation server and close that down, and then it finishes And so it's if I had to guess, it's probably that, like, people like, something's getting hung up. Nobody's getting to close it down that day. And then days and days are kinda building up. Makes sense. Trying to think of the Midland one specifically or the v exchange one. This one was a little Like, finicky, I think. But, yeah, I mean, do you have the automation server I could kinda give you, like, a rundown there. I do. How are you on time? Both of you, actually."

And, you know, if we can put visibility to it, maybe that's enough for it to be worthwhile and valuable. Or you know, honestly, there's a world in which we go through this, we do this work, we do discovery, and it's actually like, hey, you know, there's not as much, need for it as we thought because of, like, the way that the systems are currently set"

They just had an error with their biggest client while they where visiting one that once a week two done daily, renames, puts them in an uploaded folder then puts it in the FTP. for a few days it wasn't grabbing one of those filess\n\n*Saydee flagged this too\n\nWe wouldn't know for the automation if it was failed, went and rebuilt it so they could do it, but missed \n\nThen it James have a type of signifier then the date, and we had it so it was grabbing the actiivty file twice rather than grabbing the activity and the notes file, the whole reason it was rebuilt so we could have some \n\nJust like they have automations that send those files, we have automations that interact and send them down and used to have a couple that would interact with the website. We had an automation that would manuver, and move through the website appropriately and that was done in Win-automation and that wasn't supported anymore. \n\nThere's a lot of stuff in Win automation that it's very \n\nIt's going to vary a lot dependign on the automation, the things that are done in power automate most of it is moving a file around or changing something about the file, the task scheduler kicks off a bat file then kicks of a bat file. then connects to CLS, collection master, verdican, V exchange which is an information file exchange platform, they also manage that\n\nFor a lot of our clients one of the FTPs we connect to is V exchange, we have a bunch of clients we don't directly connect to, they have those same servcies\n\nVanalytics,\n\nVelocity as a client, once CLS spits those outs, most of those it does in the backend\n\nFrom there once CLS has done that there's a separate task in task scheduler in power automate, James usually rename it, for some it James change the formatting of the file, James remove all the \n\nWhich of these automations just depends, usually it's a file place\n\nEven something as simple as we know we got files today, that there was a successfull connection to the client you know you don't have to check things.\n\nPowerBI, vauge understanding that it's a powerful for reporting, would love to be able to do that, when it's like our biggest file is visiting next week, they're very particular about spending on time that's suddently not working\n\n## Meeting Notes\n\n### Current Automation Infrastructure\n\n- Use Power Automate for majority of file transfers to/from client FTPs\n- Automations built by non-technical predecessors lacking proper error reporting\n- Recent issue: biggest client visiting, automation failed to grab one of their daily files for several days\n  - System showed “successful” but file wasn’t actually moved\n  - Had to rebuild automation to add proper error checking with if statements\n  - Missed grabbing notes file vs activity file due to naming confusion\n- Legacy WinAutomation systems no longer supported, causing ongoing problems\n  - Need to rebuild automations in Power Automate as they fail\n  - Inconsistent setup across different automations\n\n### Technical Stack & Workflow\n\n- Task Scheduler → BAT file → INI file → CLS (Collection Master/Vertican)\n- CLS processes files in backend (4AM, 7AM runs)\n- Power Automate handles file movement, renaming, formatting changes\n- Key systems:\n  - CLS/Collection Master (Vertican)\n  - V Exchange (file exchange platform)\n  - vAnalytics (website interface)\n  - Velocity (client system)\n- File naming: client identifier + type signifier + date\n- Process: CLS output → rename for client format → upload folder → FTP transfer\n\n### Current Pain Points\n\n- No centralized documentation - significant time spent troubleshooting inherited systems\n- Manual email checking for FTP transfer confirmations\n- Multiple failure points across 4+ step processes\n- Power Automate FTP connection issues (works in FileZilla, fails in Power Automate)\n- Justin handles all automation maintenance solo\n- Vacation/emergency coverage requires manual intervention\n- Scalability concerns: each new client requires 2+ new automations\n\n### Business Impact & Growth Constraints\n\n- Automation failures affect multiple departments (Sadie’s team, legal account managers, clients)\n- Client format changes require weeks of testing, causing delays\n- Current infrastructure not scalable for 2-3x growth plans\n- Justin pulled from strategic projects (Power BI research) for firefighting\n- Critical processes depend on single person availability\n\n### AutomateFlow Integration Strategy\n\n- Goal: Replace Power Automate with unified AutomateFlow platform for consistency\n- Easier cross-system tracing and maintenance\n- Centralized dashboard for password updates, connection testing\n- Better error handling and monitoring capabilities\n- Enable business scaling without proportional infrastructure complexity\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

And I realized we, I'm sure Charles has specific stuff he he wants  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: to talk about, but could you talk to me about, like, what are one or two things that you're like, hey. These are the most on of, like, if AutomateFlow could help us fix these, it would actually, like, FlowBuilder my life materially easier day to day.  \nThem: Well, right now,  \nMe: Oh, right.  \nThem: we use Power Automate for the the lion's share of moving files to and from, like, FTPs from clients, which is kinda like  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: the the kinda client side stuff that I do. Right?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But other than that, I I think that, like, that's probably the only, like, client's phrasing stuff because a lot of stuff I do is, like, keeping our equipment running. Right? Like, making making CLS behave. Right? Interfacing with CLS, stuff like that.  \nMe: Yeah. And my deep  \nThem: So I think  \nMe: like, telemetry, like, if, like, if something goes wrong, like, are are you alerted ahead of time? Like, are there do you have warnings, or is it kind of, like, after the fact that, like, something's  \nThem: For for some things, there are. For some things, there aren't. The people that,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: crafted the the automations were people that came in before me, right, that I don't I don't you know, I'm not I'm not disparaging them, but I don't think that they were necessarily, like, tech professionals because a lot of these aren't set up in such a ways to where, like, there's good places for, like, error reporting. Like, we just had one where like, our biggest client while they were visiting. Right? We have have a couple of files that get generated for them. Once that's once a week and two that are done daily. Right? And all that happens is is that the automation you know, it it looks for these files, renames them how they expect. Puts them into a, you know, an uploaded folder so that we know that it's been moved right. And puts them on the FTP for them. Right?  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: Well, we had a for a couple of days, it wasn't grabbing one of those files. Right? And so one of the people that were here at the time wanted you know, all all the we would know for the automation was just whether it you know, failed and had an error or whether it didn't. And there wasn't, you know, an if statement set up to check that. Right? And the way that it was laid out didn't really allow for that. Right? So I went and rebuilt that. So that we could do that. But when I did that, I missed one of the these files are named, like, r r, like, identifier, right, like, e a t o or l a four depending on, like, who it is.  \nMe: The client, what you're working  \nThem: Then, like, a  \nMe: depending on the client.  \nThem: sorry. Say again? Yeah. Depending on the client, right, how we communicate with them. Then it'll have, like, usually, like, a type of signifier of what the file kind of is and then, like, the date. Right? And that's just in the file name. Right? And we had it to where it was grabbing, like, the activity file twice rather than grabbing the activity file and the notes file. And then popping them over to the thing. So that the whole reason that it  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: was rebuilt was just so I could, you know, have it built in such a way to where we have if statements around there to build out to where hey. You know, shoot off an email if, like, this file isn't there. You know? Continue. Right? Do whatever, but have this so that someone can come back and check it.  \nMe: That makes no sense. Okay. Great. And I I I appreciate that. Super super helpful context. Think, honestly, we'll we'll be we should be able help with a lot of this stuff. And is this the same issue we talked I spoke to Sadie about a week and a half ago. Is this, like, the same problem she was talking about where, like, sometimes they have transfers that are just dropped, or is this a separate automation that is like, sometimes just, like, dropped  \nThem: I I I think that that's probably what she's talking about.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Another thing that we do have is, like, just like where we have automations that send off those files. Right? We have automations that interact with STPs and pull those files down. We have a we or rather we used to have a couple that that also would interact, like, on the website. Right? If for clients that, like, hey. You know, the only way to grab our files is to go on the website and grab them. Prefer they have an FTP, but, you know, whatever. You know? So we had, like, an automation that would you know, maneuver and and, like, move to this website appropriately. But that was done in WinAutomation. And WinAutomation isn't anymore from my understanding. And, additionally, you know, there's a bunch of automations that were set up in WinAutomation that just you know, it it's very clear that this functionality has been replicated since Empower Automate. Right? And just those have been, like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: slowly having this or that problem that are just like, hey. And when I go to research it, well, it's not supported anymore, you really shouldn't  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So just well, let's go ahead and rebuild it and, like, power automate and that kind of thing. Right?  \nMe: Okay. Awesome. I I appreciate it. I didn't mean to, FlowBuilder you, like, reexplain  \nThem: No. That's fine.  \nMe: that stuff, Justin, but it was just was helpful but I and sorry. Wanted to quickly, introduce, Jordan who is he'll he's the person who James actually FlowBuilder you guys successful day to day. So, like, if we end up working together, he'll be the person over, like, the first ninety or so days that'll help you guys build out the first couple of key use cases that we identify. And then working you'll be working with the our technical account manager team, going forward. But I think the two things I wanted to do on call. One, actually, most importantly, a chance to introduce Jordan because you James be working with him a lot going forward if we do end up partnering. And there's one or two, sort of, like, process things that I wanted to get aligned on and when Charles gets off the call, we can, check with that with him. But, Jordan, do you wanna real quick give  \nThem: Sure. Yeah. Good to meet you guys.  \nMe: an introduction?  \nThem: Alex said, I'm Jordan. I'm a a solutions architect here, so I get to work with all our new customers coming on and help build out in AutomateFlow. And I focus on building use cases, but also enabling the teams to FlowBuilder sure and teach and and explain AutomateFlow and FlowBuilder sure you can build out these cases yourself by the time we're done in the first ninety days. So I love it. I love getting in the weeds and building AutomateFlow and automating as much as I can. It really gives me a lot of energy. So excited to meet you guys and more about this and and keep going. So  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Alright.  \nMe: I guess, actually I guess, actually, while Charles is waiting, we can probably Justin, just, like, maybe keep talking a bit more about some of these  \nThem: Death.  \nMe: that you're talking about. Could you talk to me about kind of what's your flow, like, within Power Automate today? Like, if you if when you had to, like, go FlowBuilder that automation that FlowBuilder those changes, like, what did that take? How were you able to, like, connect to, like, the different systems? And reason I'm asking is, like, part of what we wanna FlowBuilder sure is that to Jordan's point, both we James help you guys build some of these, but we also wanna enable you so that, like, something changes or if you want to modify the process that it is relatively easy to do. So curious about what kind of your current workflow is like when you're having to FlowBuilder adjustments to these things.  \nThem: Sure. It it's gonna vary a lot depending on, like, what the automation is. Right? But, for the most part, the the things that are done in Power Automate, most of it is just either, moving a file around, right, or it's just rearranging something about the file. Right? So, like, we have goodness. What what is what the task scheduler was called nowadays? Yeah. Yeah. Task scheduler. Right. And task scheduler kicks off that file, right, which kicks off an INI file, which automates something in CLX. Right? CLS does its process. It spits its file out in its, its home folder. Right?  \nMe: Yeah. It differ  \nThem: Then  \nMe: Contact CLS is, like, their, like, legal CRM that they use, to process.  \nThem: Yeah. You might also hear it called collection master. If you hear people say Vertican, Vertican is the company that makes collection master. Additionally, you'll hear v exchange, which is like an information kind of, like, file exchange platform that works between them. Right? Vertican also manages that.  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: Right? Like, so, for for a lot of our clients, one of the FTPs that we connect to to get know, like, client files or whatnot is the Right? We have a bunch of clients that we don't directly connect to them. Right? They connect to to Verticans v exchange service. Right? They put their files there. We connect to that same service, grab those, and communicate that way. Right? And I believe v analytics a lot of v's. Right? I believe vAnalytics is the, the website that we  \nMe: Okay. So yeah. Yeah. Okay. Burger can  \nThem: like, looked at in the right  \nMe: Exchange and then vAnalytics.  \nThem: Yeah. And and then we also have, like, velocity of the client and, I think there's two more v's that, like, are just lost in the memory. Right? But once once CLS kinda, like, spit those out, and most of this, right, it does in the back end. Right? Some of these is doing, like, a 4AM. Right? Some of them are at 7AM before everybody gets in, that kind of  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: from there, once CLS has, like, done that, there's a separate task and task scheduler that James kick off Power Automate. And, usually, all it does from there is it'll grab that file. It usually James rename it. Right? Because we  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: match whatever the client's doing. For some of them, it's going to to to change the formatting of the file. Maybe it goes in and removes all of the the commas in the file and replaces them with pipes. Have the proper formatting for that client. Right? And then moves that somewhere or puts it to an FTP from there. So which of these automations and, like, what they interact with just depends. Usually, there's with, like, a file placed on the server, and we're interacting with, like, an FTP that's, like, one of the clients and, like, connecting that up and that kind of thing.  \nMe: Do you feel  \nThem: And, you know, moving the file, like, intelligently, like, through our file so that we could, like, oh, you know, let's look at our uploaded folder. Okay. We've sent it to them, right, like and and moving from there.  \nMe: Do you feel like you spend a lot of your time, like, just doing, like, the tech work? Because I imagine, like, it's because it sounds like there's, like, several different systems, but it may not necessarily documented anywhere of, oh, this flows to here, then this flows to here. And so when something breaks, like, you go figure it out because you've worked in this stuff and, like, you know, you're smart, but it probably takes you quite a a while versus if a more central place for all this existed. Is that  \nThem: Right. Yeah. When when it's a system that's kinda, like, been inherited, there there's a lot of that, right, where, like, you know, you know, a client is reporting something that's going on and, like, one of these automations don't have an intelligent way that's set up, you know, to where all I see is that, you know, we got greens and it ran and it was successful. Right? But, like, client's reporting something differently. And then when we go you know, send okay. Well, let's tear open the automation. Let's see. Okay. It moved it from here. Okay. Well, let's go look  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: what's over there. Let's look at the INI file. Let's kinda go from there. There's a lot of catch up because, like,  \nMe: Let me  \nThem: these weren't laid down by me. So a lion's share of my time whenever anything goes wrong is figuring out, okay. Well, like, how do we have that set up already?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Because there's very little documentation. And sometimes it might be you know, we have some very old documentation, and and we can, like, you know, you can kinda get a hint from here, and, like, maybe you can go ask people to  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: been here a while. Right? But there's you know, like, Charles probably runs in this too a lot. Too where, like, you can get some hints, but if it's not something that they directly have done, they probably have some hints, and you might just get stuck.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So that's what a lot of my time is end up doing that. Yeah.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, it it is what it is. You know,  \nMe: Great. I mean, well, not great, but helpful. Yeah.  \nThem: thing the thing that's gotta run, we gotta figure it out. You know what I mean?  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. And so, Charles, glad thanks for joining in. Sorry. Jordan, I could can I ask you to give your intro again?  \nThem: I apologize. We  \nMe: No worries.  \nThem: we we're working on some electronically filing. We had a client that came on-site, and we realized that the numbers we were reporting were incorrect. So we're are now backing that out and trying to FlowBuilder that work. And I just I put in a ticket, and  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: they they chose 01:00 to call me back. So sorry about that.  \nMe: No. I mean, hey. That's it is important. Right? Like, a client a client's stuff breaks, like, trust me, I've been there a 100 times. So, appreciate appreciate it. I mean, I I guess  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: we can we can I wanted the main thing I wanted to do is FlowBuilder  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: you and Jordan got introduced? Can and then there was, like, one or two. I was like, hey. Like, what technical things we want to, like, act start working towards in the next couple weeks? And then there's one really just, like, process thing that I wanted to, Charles, flag to you just because I think there's a risk it could be a blocker, full transparency, but I want to get your  \nThem: So it looks like  \nMe: transparent reaction here. So  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: we have not been able to find good law firm references. Like,  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: we look internally and transparently. We don't have existing enterprise customers who, like, are doing the same of like, the exact same types of things, like, in law. We have lots of, like, fast moving, like, large document in intake type processes. And, honestly, I just, like, you know, how just wanna get a sense, like, how much of that is, like, a a deal breaker? Like, if we I feel like we've done pretty good work internally to say, hey. This is, what you guys use as company. This is how we would, like, partner with you guys. But I could also see a world in which if mister Eastpoint is like, well, I just, like, won't trust him unless I have a reference.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And if, like, if that's the world we're in, think we it's better that we find that out like, sooner rather than later, if that makes sense.  \nThem: I don't think it's a huge impediment I think it's just more so not reinventing the wheel. You know, if you're already doing it for a firm and these are some of the processes that you're doing for them, how is it being done so we can expedite us getting to our finish line? But I don't think it's huge impediment as long as it's it's beneficial to us as a company getting there.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know? So I don't I don't I I think I don't I don't foresee that as being a blocker in this scenario.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: I think he's a I think he's a big results based person, right, to where he he doesn't like he's a I referred him as a red. Kind of personality. Right? He wants the direct details. He he doesn't care about the other stuff.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So I if if my advice for kind of, like, changing his whole outlook on that would be to just have any any of the like,  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: show one of these processes. Right? Like, have one of these to where it's like, like, I mean, like, I think, Sadie has a bunch of them that, like she's got, like, a list  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: of, like, stuff she wants to have cranked out. Right? Like, you get any of these things to where, like, hey. Here's just one running. Here's just a process where here's what they were doing first. Right? And have him, like, have Cdaniel sit there and do that process. Right? And then be like, now here's what we're doing with AutomateFlow. Right? And then show have her, you know, push that button or whatever process you guys have, right, to be boom. Have him see in real time, hey. Look. Here's what they're doing. Yeah. Here's what it could do. And then hit him with, and this takes place. Like, dozens, if not you know, like, tens of dozens of of times throughout our different processes that just this department has. Right? Once you can, like, see I I think that, like, the way that, like, he does business and and, again, this is you know, I don't I don't hang out with the man.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: Right? But just like my famous phrase. It's like, I don't use know how the clock works. I just know wanna know what time it is. Exactly. Right. He doesn't he doesn't care about the how the sausage is made. He cares that it's flavored properly and everybody's happy with it. Right? Yeah. So  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: so I think we're good. I think we're good. Just just get one of these to where he can say, like, here's what was happening, and here's what and and FlowBuilder it apparent, right, to where he can he can clock it. You know what I mean? He can say to you, do that again.  \nMe: No.  \nThem: Stopwatch. You know? FlowBuilder it very clear. Right? He he's not a  \nMe: What's up?  \nThem: he's not a techie kinda guy. Right? Like, if if we go in too much in the weeds, he's gonna get lofty. He's gonna, like, he's gonna look to me or Charles and and have one of us give an answer. You know what I mean? Yeah. Definitely.  \nMe: I that that, I think, makes a lot of sense. And I've I've was I thought that was gonna be the direction by one to, like, FlowBuilder sure we have the with the conversation because I know that was a thing he specifically asked for, I wanted to, like, directly address it. So but I I agree with kind of the direction you guys going, and I think that's a good segue into, honestly, what I think James spend most of the time talking about, and this is where I think Jordan James probably start doing more of the talking than me, is like, hey, which of these, like, does FlowBuilder sense? To start with? Like, let's say if we're gonna do one of these before we, like like, formalize a contract, what, like, would which one would that be? Yeah.  \nThem: Automation wise or or just any from any perspective of what would what we've been kinda discussing?  \nMe: I guess I I guess I'm saying automation wise. So, like, I was thinking of of the example that Justin just  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: gave of, like, hey. Like, you know, that process that Cd have told us about, she's like, you know, we're dropping three or four a week, and it's causing us a lot of stress. Like, if we can build a process where hey. It just works and she doesn't have to check it anymore. I guess, but as I say that, it probably is not the best, like, illustrative example because it's more of, like, it takes away work versus, like, she's actively doing something. But wanna see, like, what is the  \nThem: She's a manager, so she has she her plate is overflowing.  \nMe: what is the yeah.  \nThem: So anything that would help with anything in client services would help move that knee. I I honestly would would focus more on on the client services thing. That particular one,  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: he's talking about additionally has been fixed. Because that was that was just an automation that we had to rebuild due to  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: a request to rebuild the thing, and we just didn't have it set to grab the right file. And and see, that's that's kind of the thing that I wanted or just the some of the automations I did wanna address is because right now, if we have an automation and there's an update or a fix to it, it pulls Justin off of so many other projects to where it's like, alright. If we have something in place with AutomateFlow, where we can change your routing or we can add something to it or we can whatever that fix might be in AutomateFlow, that's some of the automations I I that I know I I talked with Alex about since we've been on the since we've been communicating is, you know, just some of those those those sorts of fixes. Like, that automation that you're speaking of, what what was that one written in? That's just in power automate. And and, like, that's that's a you know, something that, like, AutomateFlow could be very useful for. Right? Because, like, right now, you know, we have you know, they show us something. Yeah. Yeah. I can show you guys kinda how it looks. Okay. Let me let me share my screen. Let me just share this. The go to waste. Say say what? I said I want that good Bronco grill to go to waste back there. Is that a Bronco? Yeah. I didn't mean that. I'm old. So let me let me kinda show how how this guy goes. Right? And are you the only Justin who makes changes in Power Automate today? Or I'm sorry if you guys Yeah. Yeah. That this is all stuff that I manage. Okay. So let me let me think of one of these. It'd be a good one to do. And these are just as an example of what he has to maintain, shortlist probably. It's And if if it breaks or, you know, if he has to manually jump kick it off, that sort of thing like it's Exactly. Right? So, like, let let's say and I well, actually, we'll we'll go kinda in the order that I'll, like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: check things. Right? So, like, let's say we we got we'll we'll go through, like, Cd's thing. Right? So say we got, okay. Hey. You know, tracks reporting that, like, hey. They're not getting their notes files, right, which was specifically what was going on and, like, some of the activities were missing. Too. So I was like, okay. First thing I'm gonna check is let's go. And and and me because, like, there's a lot of folders here, so I may click the wrong place. As long as you know where they are, we're alright.  \nMe: Hello? Watching you do this, I think, is actually really helpful for us because it, like, gives us context of, like, how  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.  \nMe: you actually work day to day. I don't apologize for anything here.  \nThem: Gotcha. Right. So I'm gonna look in my my track placement. Right? So from and and what all this is, right, we got, like, our big you know, like, file server. Right? From there, we have, like, the imports specifically. They're just, hey. Here's things that are going to and from clients. Right? All the clients listed here. Right? And some miscellaneous other stuff down here. Here. We're speaking about track, which is track American system. Right? And, of course, from here, we're looking at uploads. So first, I'll look at uploads. I'll look at uploaded, and I'll see okay. Let's say they were let's say that these two weren't here, right, for yesterday. So there's there's not a notes and activity file here. They get the maintenance file on a Friday. Right? So today, you know, for instance, tomorrow, if there's not one of these in here, there's a problem. Right? Let's say these ones aren't in here. Next thing I would check is is I check my in this particular case, I would check my email because whenever we send something to their to the FTP for track, they send me an email if they've received that file. So the next thing I'm gonna do is is check to FlowBuilder sure, hey. Did they get that file? If if I don't see an email from them,  \nMe: And just  \nThem: you know, during that time frame, we have a problem, right? So from there,  \nMe: you're doing you're checking that manually today. Like, you don't have, like, a Power BI that's, like, scraping your  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: email on, like, when when it comes in or something? Okay. That's  \nThem: No. It's just, hey. The email comes in. Check it. You know what I mean? Did confirm that I got one in this case.  \nMe: That makes sense. Honestly, that might be maybe, Justin, you and I could do, like, a working session because that's something I think we could set up for you in, like, literally thirty minutes probably, on, like, a email. Like, when those emails come in,  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: Just, keep a list. And if, like, you know, come in one day, send you a notification. Is, like, you and I can work on that while Jordan, like, helps Sadie with some of the more complex ones. I just wanted to side note, to sidetrack on that.  \nThem: That's good. Yeah. I mean, like and I James say that, like, there's a lot of things for, like, systems as a whole that are that are like that. Right? They rely on, like, me or somebody else like, hey. You know, And and, like, it it's one thing to, like, hey. You get an email when something's gone wrong. Right? Like, that that's that's quite simple. To to to remember to, you know, to do something about. Right? It's quite something else when it's did this email get received? And if you didn't get this email received,  \nMe: Do something.  \nThem: you know, And so we had that for, like, a lot of things like that. So probably there's more things like that we could work with. But but kinda rolling back over here, Right? So let's say these didn't go in. I don't have an email confirming that they got that. So the next thing I'm gonna do is I know that you know, CLS, once it's made that file, it puts it in its home folder. I'm a look in its home folder. Right? And I'm gonna see if there's one of these. Right? Like, here's today's. Right? Now this hasn't moved over because it does this a little later in the day. Right? And the notes file, it's, like, one twenty three right now. The notes file might still be being made because that one takes quite some time for CLS to run through that Right? So it just because it pulls a lot of information. So I see that it's here. So that means that I know that CLS made it. Right? So from there, we'll go over to track exports. And we'll say, okay. Well, that means it just didn't move the file maybe. Right? Or, actually, before we would go to track exports, this one's a little harder to, like, simulate, but we'll pull up power automate. Wait for it to load up. And while this is loading, just context. So activity might be, like, payments or or the you know, that type information on a file. Notes might be something that some of the client service reps or just someone notated the file. Maintenance might be saying, the file is still open or if it needs to be closed or somebody's deceased and those sorts of things. So we're just updating the credit files that are in the system in CLS. We're just we're just sending information that we have up to them to FlowBuilder sure that and they have automated systems on their end, right, that just check to FlowBuilder sure that we have parity with them. Right? Yeah. And and they have certain for because those systems are automated, right, they have certain formats that they gotta receive it. So we work in an CLS and their systems. They just wanna FlowBuilder sure that they're reporting on tracking the same things that we're actually working. And if they're a big enough client. Right? Because because for instance, right, we have MCM right now. Right? Midland. I believe our second biggest client they have a brand new way that they wanna receive, like, financial information right. And initially, when they were testing that, we us and a couple other firms that work with them built some custom just to kinda test their automated systems. Right? And for that, like, you know, I built out, like, a little, like, Python thing that just does, like, a SQL query and puts it in the proper  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: format for them. Right? But you know, they're moving to the next phase of that where it's a bigger one. And for that, they're they've already worked with the Vertican, and now CLS James just out that. But if it were a smaller client, admittedly, us having a good way to wear hey. You know, you know, grab x file from this location. And rearrange it. What I mean? Like, you know, FlowBuilder this for the header. You know? Have this type of spacing. Right? You know, or this type of pipe for this kind of thing. Little things like that can be very helpful. For for smaller clients. Because I don't know and I say all that to say, I don't imagine that Vertican would FlowBuilder these for us or or FlowBuilder these without costing us a lot of money, if that makes sense, custom solutions.  \nMe: Makes a ton of sense.  \nThem: I'm a little long winded. I apologize. But getting back over here. Right? So let's say that one of these had, like, a failure. Right? I would look and see, okay. You know, where's that failure? But there's not a failed one. Right? Which this happens sometimes where there's everything looks green. Right? But I know that the file didn't get moved there because it's it's physically not in that folder. So we could check-in here. Right? And we can you know, whichever one of these actions are related to the movement of that file, we can kinda check these and get a little more information from it. Right? We have some input and output that we get.  \nMe: So  \nThem: You know,  \nMe: question.  \nThem: Greg?  \nMe: You have, like, the like, if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying in in the failure case, like, one of those lines at the detail level would say fail, but the top level still succeed because it, like, meet hit some end condition somewhere.  \nThem: It depends. Some of these have been set up for to where that's the case, and some of them haven't been set up that way. Some of them James James have can  \nMe: Got  \nThem: to where they'll discontinue, and some of them James just fail. And and I believe that that's just because we've had separate people building them, so they have been set up consistently. Some of the older ones just like, for instance, this one specifically does the grabbed all the files and reports over to track. We have one that does a lot of, like, the smaller clients in one automation. For that one, we have ones in there that like, we're not we didn't even, like, use that client anymore, and they had to be turned off. And we had a different one with track. Where be cut oh, no. I'm sorry. It was this one with track where because on only on Fridays, does it send off a a maintenance file. Right? They only want that from us one to  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: week. There wasn't a condition in the automation to check to see if that file existed or to check to see if the current day was, you know, Friday or whatever. So it would get to the end of that automation every single day and just fail except for Fridays. And so you check to FlowBuilder sure nothing else failed on it. Until we you know, I rebuilt it in the thing.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: To account for that. If that answers your question, I'm not sure if it would be.  \nMe: It definitely did. Okay. So taking a taking a step back from being, like, like, through, path forward here in terms of how  \nThem: Uh-huh.  \nMe: how do we actually like, to your point, like, hey. Let's, like, get something, like, working for you guys where we can, like, show this is this difference. Jordan, let me know if you have a different point of view on this, but my my hypothesis is you, Charles, and probably, Cdaniel should have like, I know I know I actually, she gave  \nThem: Mercedes.  \nMe: us a lot of details. Or maybe it's not Cdaniel, but the the I know. Sorry. I've been but maybe the meeting isn't with her, but, like, the person the guy  \nThem: Oh, okay. Got got you. Got you.  \nMe: her. To, like, talk through the the, like, very technical details so we can, like, map out, hey. Like, how do we actually build this AutomateFlow? It sounds like Justin fixed that one the specific problem of those dropping, but I remember there was, like, two or three others as well that she had flagged to us, like, this would be helpful. So I think having you Charles, Sadie, meet, or her team, right, to meet to, like, hey. Like, this is that one. And then Justin, you and I, I think there's, like, some places where we can help you build, like, even on top of the current system, just, like, FlowBuilder  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: your life a bit easier, right, to, like, not  \nThem: Probably. Yeah.  \nMe: just, like, so you could, like, know. Right? So you're not having to, like, go back and, like, check a bunch of different different places, for some of these things. And, like, I can I can help with that because it's much, like, much simpler than I think some of the stuff we're gonna be doing with Sadie? And then just in terms of, on the references what I'm gonna do, I just wanted to preview this with you, Charles, before sending an email, but I'm gonna have Kurt, who is the legal counsel who joined our conversation, basically send mister Eastpoint a note saying, like, hey. We checked, but we are we do wanna partner with you and, like, we're this is how we're thinking about doing that, the just to FlowBuilder sure just, preview that for him so he's not, like, caught off guard, you know, when we come with, like, the builds that we're doing and, like, how we're thinking about proving value. Does that sound like a reasonable sort of, like, plan path forward to everyone? Anything we we want to adjust there.  \nThem: It does, but I do have a course  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: right, before we go down that path. So what you're looking at AutomateFlow would only interact with what we have in Power Automate. Not be a replacement or enhancement internally? Like, what what are what are your thoughts on what  \nMe: I guess  \nThem: you've seen so far? I don't know if that's a Jordan question or  \nMe: my yeah. No. No. My initial reaction, honestly and maybe this is probably more of a same but I I I can give my thoughts. It's like, I think in the the goal would be to eventually replace Power Automate because if you can have it all on AutomateFlow, it's easier to, like, trace across things. Like, part of what it sounds like Justin's spending a lot of time doing today  \nThem: Yeah. If everything was consistent, that'd be helpful.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know? Because right now, you know, like, I can I can work in PowerOn  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Right? I can work in all of these systems, but you know, these there's you know, this fires off you know, the INI file from there. Right? Okay. That's fine. You kinda saw there's, like, four steps and I coulda kept going on here. Right? Like, this this these problems  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: mean, you guys are tech guys. You guys all understand, like, things can break down in a lot of places.  \nMe: I understand. The more the more hand off.  \nThem: And there there's a lot of hunting. Right?  \nMe: The more opportunities, yeah. But  \nThem: And The reason why I'm I'm go ahead. No. Go ahead. I'm sorry. But if I but I I James say that, like, while I'm I'm comfortable, like, you know, like, building new solutions and that kind of thing within Power Automate and continuing doing that. Right? If if if we had it to where, like, look. You know, we have a consistent you know, something set up to where look. All I really gotta do is look. The client changed the the password. For the FTP. I open up my little, you know, what you call it, dashboard or or whatever, you know, panel. Right? And I just go here and click, alright. Let's go to track. They changed it. Let me put here Let me let me hit a test. Okay. It connected to it. Whatever. Cool. You know, that that would be better And that whole thing, you know, if it has if it can cover hey. Things coming in and things going out, like, that's perfect, really, because because, realistically, CLS, like, spits out everything that we need 90% of the time.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then from there, it's just a matter of, like, hey. This person's gotta know what's going on with this kind of thing. Then this person's got it. You know? And, like, I believe that, like, PandaDoc is kinda like, being a big, like, help to, like, stay about that as a problem, keeping people informed. Right? But everything else being a little bit more consistent than what's been set up like, would be helpful. Right? And and these are things to where given enough time, right, like, yeah, I could, like, get these all squared away, but there's a lot to do. And there's a lot of other things that require my attention too. So, like, help for that kind of thing would be handy. And I bring it up because not only is it beneficial just for Justin, but is it beneficial for the firm?  \nMe: Yep. Yeah.  \nThem: And those are the selling points that it sounds like you're looking for. Right? So  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: if you okay. Let's say we knock out PandaDoc, right, which you know, it might be a task or a chore, but beyond that, what else would you want? And these are the types of benefits that Justin's describing because it is. It's very he's very intimate with the process. Even though he he has there's there's a lot better use of  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: time sometimes, and then spending two hours tracking down an issue only to say that, oh, well, let's put this comma here that you're marking now. And I'm it's it's not that granular. But, you know, sometimes with coding, that's how we do this. Right? It's usually guys know it's a comma. You know? It it's a it's a oh, the file name looked for yesterday's date. It needs to look for today's date or or the reverse of that, oddly enough.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So those are the that's why I'm I'm almost spending some time here because this automation if there is a automation that's not working or it's providing an issue, then that affects every  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: affects multiple departments. It'll affect the city. It James affect, you know, the legal account manager It could affect it's a trickle effect. So that's why know, I wanted to start Everything runs through here. Exactly. So you know, and it affects our clients because they FlowBuilder a change the way that their financial file needs to be formatted. And we have to continue testing that for two weeks. Now we're two weeks behind. So now we have to catch up. Now there's a, you know, there's a there's some type of  \nMe: I I think that was one of things he was talking  \nThem: there's a reversal. There was a yeah.  \nMe: Mhmm.  \nThem: That's why I'm spending the time here. It's just no. You're fine. And that's just why I'm saying, like, if there is some of these types of things that we can incorporate and transition over, that makes so many other pieces of the puzzle come together much easier.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Where it's an automatic sale. You know? It's it's it's it's it's not that you know, it's I think the selling piece is gonna be the easy component.  \nMe: That makes sense. Justin, one I guess one follow-up question is, like, if if for this if for the sake of argument, if we could, like, take this off your plate, you just, like, never had to think about it anymore. Like, what are, like, one or two things, like, you would be doing that you feel like you don't have, like, time to do today?  \nThem: He probably hadn't had the chance to think about it. I mean, yeah, it'd kinda it's yeah. It's a little it's a little crazy to to think about, but but, realistically, right, even even if we even if we think way less broad, than, like, we currently are. Right? Like, let let's just say, like, hey. Making sure that even something as simple as we just know that we we got files today. Right? There was a successful connection to this to, like, the client right, means I know I don't have to check things. You know what I mean? Like like, our our even something like because, like, you guys have, like, talked about Power BI before, which isn't something I personally work with before, but I've heard of before. Right? Like and I and I have some vague understandings that, like, it's a a powerful tool for reporting that we could be incorporating. Right? And and, like and I would love to have the time to, like, oh, let me let me dig into, like, do some research. Let's see how Power BI works. Let's see how it connects with our stuff. But we can't do that whenever, hey. Like, our biggest client is visiting, you know, next week, And, hey. You know that reporting file that we give to them every day that they're kind of, like, really let me think of, like, a an appropriate word They're they're very peculiar about. They're very stern about receiving on time. I Hey. That's suddenly not working, and you have 12 places to look. You know what I mean? And and it's it's that way with a lot of things. And there's some things that we're not gonna be able to change. Right? Because it's like it's deeply ingrained with this and that kind of process. But there's a lot that  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: isn't Right? And, like, those things just being better. And and as far as like, you know, mister Eastpoint wanting the you know, wanting those examples, The reason that he's wanting that, he's just wanting, hey. Whatever problems we have, his assumption is these guys have had that problem with two. So if these guys have worked with someone who's had the same problem, it skips a bunch of nonsense.  \nMe: That means a  \nThem: Show to him that a bunch of nonsense can be skipped. And you'll I think you'll have a better better shot at it to sell for. Don't get caught in details. Yeah. And I think another part of it is sometimes a lot of times with us as well, it's not always an automatic hey. We save you thirty hours a week of this type of time. No. It becomes a the data that drives all of the you know, the back end data that would drive what takes place for the next day's production may or may not run. If Justin has a vacation or he has a you know, god forbid, he has a an emergency of some type, now it still happens with or without him being there. He doesn't have to bring his laptop on vacation and, you know, those of things and and hit a button to click an automation. Like, it's so much deeper than just a a time replacement, and that those are the sorts of selling points that become a it's it's it's replicated. It always runs. It's stable. You know? Like, those are really points to hone in on because it it is. Like, you know, not only can it it it's something that's easily easier to maintain, but it it just it allows for that that that peace of mind that it's taking place.  \nMe: No. And I know you've talked a bunch too. I feel like this all goes back to, hey. If we're trying to grow two, three x with the volumes that we're doing, we just don't have the infrastructure to do it today. And this this like, if we could get AutomateFlow set up in the way that we that we think it'll work for you guys, like,  \nThem: Scalable.  \nMe: you'll be you can do and  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: like, at the at the same size of a company you are today, can serve a lot more people. Right? So  \nThem: Exactly. Yeah. As far as, like, getting files moved around, it it's not really scalable right now. Right? Like, if if if tomorrow I got an email that was like, hey. We got a new client. Right? And and let's say that, like, everything with CLS is perfect. Right? They're already using what we have in place. They're using YGC. Or whatever. Right? That still would hey. I that's that's at least you know, if I'm clever, maybe I can get it in one automation that interacts right at a clever part of the day to where it  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: grabs files and, you know, communicates back and forth. But, no, that that's two more automations that I need to build. Right? And from there, it's okay. Well, let's FlowBuilder sure our folders step in the right place, FlowBuilder sure everything's you know, we're all human. Right? So if a folder is called uploads, or uploaded, and you put uploads in there, well, you might lose ten, fifteen minutes because, you know what I mean? It it's something simple like that. Right?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So little things like that and and I I imagine that like certainly, like, I have those. And, like, you expect some of those because it's a tech world. Right? Like, those are the common things you run into. But I think on, like, a level above that or or or layer above that, I think a lot of people are dealing with, like, especially, Sadie. Yeah. Because she hears from hears about it, and and it does. Like, it's it's Anything goes wrong, Cdaniel. Catching hell for it. Even something as simple as a sandbox for him to do, you know, parallel testing to FlowBuilder sure the output's the same if he makes a change. You know, it's it's it's there, but it's not it's not in in in a it's not an environment to where he can really  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: let his talents do the work. He's doing the manual lifting and then putting his talents to work to try to  \nMe: That was a  \nThem: FlowBuilder it happen. So, you know, I I really think that that's why I hone in on these automations because it's it's the backbone of what we're doing every day. You know? Like, you know Everything that's off, these have to run. Every that that I mean, he mentioned, like, vacations. Right? You know? I I vacate I reconnected with my dad and sister. I had a great time, you know, up in South Carolina. But, you know, like, look. You know? The family looked at me and groaned as I, like, walked off from, like, the little get together. Right? Cracked the laptop open. You know? We Yeah. These things gotta get run, you know, like, regardless. And it would and for some of them, it it's, you know, like, there's it's simple things to where, like, their logic issues that I know can be solved, right, where, you know, some of these things can could just be run, and we know that they're gonna be okay. But you know, we're working with, like, Power Automate, which you know, we have a problem right now where, one of our clients they they're not getting their reporting file. And the reason that they're not getting their reporting file is Power Automate has an error whenever it tries to connect to their FTP but FileZilla does not have that error. All of the information is consistent. Everything is like that. But for some reason, right, you know, and research into it, I see that Power Automate has some type of issues with, like, modern, you know, like, FTPs and stuff like that.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: But, like, admittedly, you know, I I'm I'm a bit of a jack of all trades. I'm not an expert in everything. Know what I mean?  \nMe: I feel like this day  \nThem: So why it's doing that is a is a mystery.  \nMe: Jack of all  \nThem: Do what?  \nMe: I feel like these are the AI tools. The Jack of all trade is, like, much more useful because you you can push, like, agents towards towards, working on these topics, like doing some of those research for you, but you just need to kinda know to ask.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: No. You AI is one of those things to where if if you if you know what to ask, it can be really handy. You know what I mean? When you're you're you're coding something, you're like, oh god. Like, how do I how do we do a variable in c? How do you how do you declare a some it's great for that. Right? But, like, for you know, it it's it's it's one of those useful tools to where, hey. If you have the knowledge, right, like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: it can save you some time.  \nMe: Absolutely. Okay. So let's last step here can be let's let's look at calendars and just put some sessions on. I feel like  \nThem: Let me go ahead and  \nMe: Justin, is there would you have some time Wednesday? I'm this is  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: this is central time for context. Would you be available, like, Wednesday, noon or one central?  \nThem: Let me let me double check. Let me FlowBuilder  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: sure because they like to they like to spring some surprises on me now and then. And them also including the system. Like, Yeah. I mean, like, I you know, I may look more hairy that day if there's a particular number of fires, but everything everything is good on that day for me. I I have some stuff early in the day to take care of.  \nMe: So I'll I'll put some time on the calendar for us for one, and then we can,  \nThem: But one's great.  \nMe: if if you we we can be flexible. And  \nThem: No. The stuff I have is at nine that  \nMe: okay.  \nThem: time, so you should be fine that day.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: I should be wrapped up with all that by then. Just for context, it is a day after Mardi Gras. So be patient with us.  \nMe: That makes sense. Okay. And then what would be a good time, Oh, Jordan Charles, like, when when would be a good time for you two to connect, with Cdaniel?  \nThem: With Sadie,  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: I would have to get with Sadie. Yeah. Sorry, Jordan. I hope this is giving you some context and giving you something, but I I know you the stage has not been yours much today. No. It's all good. I'm I'm happy to listen in, and Alex's been giving you some good notes on digesting and you know, look forward to diving into a specific use case, and we can always go a lot deeper then. Getting to know more. But I got you. And I know I can be verbose. I apologize. No. It's helpful to hear and see. That's all that's all good. It's all valuable context, so definitely thank you. I can I can schedule again with you guys? To dig into, like, those templates for sure. Like,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: the the first the first hit point or transition point into PandaDoc, I think that would be a really good conversation. Oh, wait. You didn't say the templates. Yeah. It's alright. And then, you know, Sadie,  \nMe: Okay. Okay. That works.  \nThem: Sadie doesn't have to be present for that one. So  \nMe: Let's then that on full transparency, like, you'll probably be working Jordan on more of that stuff than me, like, going forward because he he's, like, the he'll, like, whereas, like, I'm sort of like, oh, like, learning. He'll be actually, like, help you figure out how to do it versus what I mostly be just talking about it. So I think those James be we'll get to, like, a lot more progress over the next couple weeks than we have going forward. But we should be that sounds good. So I guess I James, book the time with Justin Wednesday, then you Charles James get back to us when you have time next week or when, like, you'd say  \nThem: I mean, I can  \nMe: them.  \nThem: I can schedule now, but if you want to specifically, Sadie,  \nMe: Okay. Oh, no. I was  \nThem: to be included in this?  \nMe: Jordan, I'll defer to you then. What's what's what's a good window for you next week?  \nThem: Yeah. So, Charles, you wanna Monday, Tuesday given Mardi Gras? Or Yeah. It's a safe bet. We're close to works. Thursday? Tuesday? That's that's what he said in the meeting. Thursday afternoon is the only time started. I don't know. Doesn't doesn't Thursday. Thursday morning's fine for me. Cool. What time? Anytime? Yeah. Ten.  \nMe: Ten of. Okay. Cool. No.  \nThem: Ten? Let's do it. Thursdays are great as long as they're morning. Ten let's do 10:30. I have a 09:30 that tends to run long. Right? Because we have we have a call with our offshore team, and we've Let me FlowBuilder sure. Let me double check. Getting getting the house clean on that end.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: And that's 10:30. Right. 10:30 central. That's correct. No. I'm good that whole day.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Super, super helpful. Glad I got the chance to introduce Jordan. Justin, great to meet you.  \nThem: Absolutely.  \nMe: Really do. I feel like obviously, I know it's my job to sell AutomateFlow, but I really feel like we can actually, like, help you like, sort of transform the way that you're  \nThem: For sure.  \nMe: like, I think I think it can FlowBuilder a big difference, both, like, both on, like, the interpersonal side. Like, I can see, like, taking stress away from you, taking stress away from saying me, but then also, like,  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: helping the business be just more effective prepared for the future.  \nThem: There you go.  \nMe: I think we can  \nThem: Dashboards reporting all of that.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I'm excited. All this stuff's in the stone age.  \nMe: Yeah. And the other thing, Charles, we can actually now like, we can start talking pricing and stuff now because, like, I just wanted to FlowBuilder sure that we were, like, on the same page about what we were working towards and, like, all that kind of stuff we could get into, like, hey. Like, this is, like, dollars and cents. But, I think in our our next conversations, I can start sort of previewing, hey. These are, like, the pricing options that we can discuss.  \nThem: Sounds good.  \nMe: Cool. Thanks, guys. Well, hope  \nThem: Thank you all.  \nMe: a great weekend, and we'll talk to later.  \nThem: You too. Alright? You guys. Yep. See you. Alright. Y'all take care. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/bff9c537-9c80-420d-818b-2f98a69ee450](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/bff9c537-9c80-420d-818b-2f98a69ee450)\n",

Like, we just had one where like, our biggest client while they were visiting. Right? We have have a couple of files that get generated for them. Once that's once a week and two that are done daily. Right? And all that happens is is that the automation you know, it it looks for these files, renames them how they expect.

One, actually, most importantly, a chance to introduce Jordan because you James be working with him a lot going forward if we do end up partnering.

So the next thing I'm gonna do is I know that you know, CLS, once it's made that file, it puts it in its home folder. I'm a look in its home folder. Right? And I'm gonna see if there's one of these. Right? Like, here's today's. Right? Now this hasn't moved over because it does this a little later in the day. Right? And the notes file, it's, like, one twenty three right now. The notes file might still be being made because that one takes quite some time for CLS to run through that Right? So it just because it pulls a lot of information. So I see that it's here. So that means that I know that CLS made it. Right? So from there, we'll go over to track exports. And we'll say, okay. Well, that means it just didn't move the file maybe. Right? Or, actually, before we would go to track exports, this one's a little harder to, like, simulate, but we'll pull up power automate. Wait for it to load up. And while this is loading, just context. So activity might be, like, payments or or the you know, that type information on a file. Notes might be something that some of the client service reps or just someone notated the file. Maintenance might be saying, the file is still open or if it needs to be closed or somebody's deceased and those sorts of things. So we're just updating the credit files that are in the system in CLS. We're just we're just sending information that we have up to them to FlowBuilder sure that and they have automated systems on their end, right, that just check to FlowBuilder sure that we have parity with them. Right? Yeah. And and they have certain for because those systems are automated, right, they have certain formats that they gotta receive it. So we work in an CLS and their systems. They just wanna FlowBuilder sure that they're reporting on tracking the same things that we're actually working. And if they're a big enough client. Right? Because because for instance, right, we have MCM right now. Right? Midland. I believe our second biggest client they have a brand new way that they wanna receive, like, financial information right. And initially, when they were testing that, we us and a couple other firms that work with them built some custom just to kinda test their automated systems. Right?

          "description": "**SA Introduction Call — Reference blocker downgraded, prove-value phase begins** **Attendees**: Jordan Floyd (SA), Charles Daniel, Justin (IT/Automation Lead), Alex **Justin is a new key stakeholder**: Manages ALL Power Automate flows solo. Single point of failure — can't take vacation without his laptop. Spends most of his time troubleshooting inherited systems with no documentation. Power Automate has FTP bugs that FileZilla doesn't. Each new client = 2+ new automations. WinAutomation deprecated, rebuilding as things fail. Scalability is the constraint. **Reference blocker downgraded**: Charles was direct — \"I don't think it's a huge impediment.\" His read on Mr. Eastpoint: \"Red personality... doesn't care how the clock works, just wants to know what time it is.\" Advice: show one process working before/after, FlowBuilder the improvement obvious, don't get lost in details. \"Show to him that a bunch of nonsense can be skipped.\" **Charles' framing**: Not just time savings — stability (always runs), reliability (no single point of failure), scalability (grow without proportional complexity). \"Those are really the selling points to hone in on.\" **Justin selling internally**: \"It's an automatic sale... the selling piece is gonna be the easy component.\" He sees this affecting every department — trickle effect from automation failures. **Charles opened pricing conversations**: Ready to discuss dollars and cents in upcoming calls. **Jordan Floyd introduced**: James be working directly with Charles and Sadie on use cases. Justin and Alex pairing on simpler quick wins. **Two working sessions booked**: Wed Feb 11, 1:00 PM CT: Alex + Justin (email monitoring automation) Thu Feb 12, 10:30 AM CT: Jordan + Charles (PandaDoc templates integration) **Also need to schedule**: Jordan + Charles + Sadie (client services use case mapping) **Kurt email reframed**: No longer \"we don't have references, is that a dealbreaker?\" → now \"here's how we'll prove value on your systems.\" Preview with Charles first. **Outputs**: `deal-channel-update-000000000.docx`, `Kurt-Eastpoint-reframe-v2.docx`, `followup-charles-justin-000000000.docx`"

Binary choice — yes or no. **Why Kurt**: Counsel-to-counsel feels like a straight conversation, not sales pressure. Kurt was in the managers meeting and added value. **Next step**: Preview email with Charles first — get his read on how dad James receive it, any adjustments needed. Then Kurt sends.

Similar companies (even if not exact match) might work if he can empathize with their situation. Could also be a hard no.

Dad was clear this is what he needs before he can \"ask intelligent questions\" **Next steps**: Deliver customer references: Rozas Law (Arvy's account, LA-based — the firm Kurt flagged) + deal support request for 2-3 additional legal customers Schedule department discovery sessions: Client Services and LAMs priority Research competitive landscape: How many collection firms use AutomateFlow vs. alternatives?"

Files not importing or not moving to correct locations. Creates distrust, requires daily manual verification. Same issues on exports. Goal: \"out of sight, out of mind\" with alerts only on failure. 2. **Media Movement**: 500-1,000 docs/day to clients. Manual process: Paper Vision → rename (PowerShell/Excel) → move to folders → zip → FTP. Clients complaining about delays, say competitors have this automated. 3. **Missing Media Tracking**: Legal filings require specific media, comes back in massive batches. No way to track if requested items received. ~1 hour/day manual checking across multiple spreadsheets, still backed up. Holding up demand letters 3-4 weeks, delaying revenue. **Future phases** (require internal cleanup first): Affidavit automation, reporting dashboards, SalesCloud integration **Technical context**: CLS (collection software), Paper Vision (doc storage), FTP servers, Excel/PowerShell macros **Next steps**: Sayde to send screenshots of current spreadsheets and processes SA request submitted to bring in technical support for scoping Schedule working session once materials received **Deal advancement**: Use cases now concrete enough to warrant SA engagement. This is the path to a $50K enterprise deal with real, quantifiable pain."

      "content": "TeamChat to Arvy — Rozas Law Intro for Eastpoint\n\n---\n\nHey Arvy — quick ask on Rozas Law.\n\nI'm working a $50K+ deal with Eastpoint Capital, a debt collection law firm in Louisiana. Just had a managers meeting with their leadership today — demo went well, but the owner was clear: he wants to talk to 3-4 other law firms using AutomateFlow before moving forward.\n\nKurt mentioned Rozas Law came up as a potential reference — I know that was your deal. Would Matthew Rozas (COO) be open to a quick call with Eastpoint? They're both LA-based, and even though Rozas does family law / criminal defense vs. debt collection, I think the workflow patterns (high-volume doc generation, client comms, multi-department ops) are similar enough to be relevant.\n\nA few questions:\n\n1. Is Matthew still engaged and happy? Would he be a good reference?\n\n2. Any context I should know before reaching out?\n\n3. Would you prefer to FlowBuilder the intro, or should I reach out directly in #ext-rozaslaw-AutomateFlow-shared?\n\nNo rush, but this is the gating item for Eastpoint — if I can get references lined up this week, we can move to department discovery sessions.\n\nThanks!",

Introduce AutomateFlow and what it does (most attendees won't know)\n2. Show the \"art of the possible\" — what automation can do for a law firm\n3. Surface pain points from each department (discovery opportunity)\n4. Get buy-in for follow-up discovery sessions with department heads\n\n**NOT asking for:** A purchasing decision, budget commitment, or timeline\n\n---\n\n## Presentation Structure\n\n### SLIDE 1: Title\n**Eastpoint Capital × AutomateFlow**\nPartnership Introduction | January 2026\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 2: Why We're Here (3 pillars)\n\n| # | Headline | Supporting Detail |\n|---|----------|-------------------|\n| 01 | **E-Filing Changed Everything** | The January mandate didn't just add a requirement — it revealed every manual process in your operation. You're adapting. We want to help you do it once, right. |\n| 02 | **Your Team Feels the Lift** | PandaDoc, CLS, spreadsheets, signatures — staff are stitching systems together by hand. Every manual step is a risk and a cost. |\n| 03 | **Protecting What You've Built** | Louisiana's largest collection firm didn't get there by accident. Automation isn't about replacing people — it's about letting your team focus on what actually drives value. |\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 3: Timeline — What We've Built Together\n\n**Goal:** Show we've already invested, we're not just pitching\n\n| Date | Activity |\n|------|----------|\n| Dec 29 | Initial conversation with Trisha |\n| Dec 30 | Technical deep-dive with Charles — mapped 10+ use cases |\n| Jan 5 | Built working prototype: webhook → PandaDoc document creation |\n| Jan 11 | Strategy session with Trisha (Baton Rouge) |\n| Jan 16 | ROI framework review with Charles |\n| **Jan 21** | **Today: Introduction to leadership team** |\n\n**Pull quote from Charles:**\n> \"CLS → PandaDoc automation would be huge. Staff are doing a heavy lift right now to collate information and position signatures.\"\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 4: What is AutomateFlow? (60-second explainer)\n\n**The Connector Between Your Systems**\n\n- 7,000+ app integrations (CLS, PandaDoc, Outlook, TeamChat, Excel, etc.)\n- No code required — business users can build and modify\n- Enterprise security: SOC 2 Type II, SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning\n- Human-in-the-loop: Automation assists your team, doesn't replace judgment\n\n**Simple visual:** Show CLS → AutomateFlow → PandaDoc → Filing System flow\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 5: What We've Built So Far (Demo)\n\n**CLS → PandaDoc Proof of Concept**\n\nShow the working automation:\n1. Data comes in from source system (webhook)\n2. AutomateFlow processes and formats the data\n3. PandaDoc document is created with correct field mapping\n4. Ready for signature workflow\n\n**The problem it solves:**\n- Staff currently: pull data from CLS, format manually, paste into PandaDoc, position signatures\n- Automated: data flows automatically, documents created in seconds\n\n**Call out:** \"This is Phase 1. Charles and I are still working on the upstream connection to CLS — that's our next step together.\"\n\n---\n\n## Kurt'S SECTION: Art of the Possible for Legal\n\n*Kurt takes over — speaks to legal-specific pain points*\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 6: Legal Automation — Where Firms Like Yours Are Winning\n\n**Kurt TALKING POINTS:**\n\n**Opening credibility statement:**\n\"I'm Kurt, in-house counsel at AutomateFlow. My day job is running a legal operation — I deal with the same document workflows, deadline pressures, and compliance requirements you do. Let me share what I've seen work.\"\n\n**Key themes to hit:**\n\n1. **Document Assembly at Scale**\n   - Demand letters, pleadings, standard filings\n   - Template-driven generation with data pulled automatically from case management\n   - No more copy-paste errors, no more formatting inconsistencies\n   - \"When you're filing 300 suits a day, a 5-minute savings per document = 25 hours/day\"\n\n2. **Deadline and Filing Management**\n   - Court filing deadlines tracked automatically\n   - Alerts before deadlines hit — not after\n   - Automatic escalation if something is at risk\n   - \"Missed deadlines don't just cost money — they cost malpractice exposure\"\n\n3. **Intake and Triage**\n   - New matters classified automatically by type, urgency, jurisdiction\n   - Routed to the right team without manual assignment\n   - AI can extract key information from incoming documents\n   - \"Your intake team spends less time sorting, more time on substantive work\"\n\n4. **Client Communication**\n   - Status updates triggered automatically when case milestones hit\n   - Template responses for common inquiries\n   - Nothing falls through the cracks\n\n**Closing from Kurt:**\n\"The firms that are winning aren't just adding technology — they're removing friction from every step. That's what we've been building with Charles.\"\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 7: Legal Use Cases Summary\n\n| Use Case | What It Does | Impact |\n|----------|--------------|--------|\n| **Demand Letter Automation** | Data from CLS → formatted letter in PandaDoc → ready for signature | Hours/day saved on document prep |\n| **Filing Deadline Tracker** | Automatic monitoring + alerts before deadlines | Zero missed deadlines |\n| **Document Review Routing** | AI classifies documents, routes to right attorney | Faster turnaround, less bottleneck |\n| **iPerform Court Filing** | Automated submission to court filing systems | Eliminate manual upload steps |\n| **LexisNexis Batch Processing** | Consumer scrubs run automatically, results formatted | Free up research staff |\n\n---\n\n## Alex'S SECTION: Beyond Legal — Every Department Benefits\n\n*Alex takes back over*\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 8: Beyond Legal — Every Department Benefits\n\n**Opening:**\n\"Kurt showed you what's possible in legal ops. But here's the thing — every department in this room has the same pattern: manual handoffs, data living in different systems, people spending time on tasks that software should handle.\"\n\n**Use Cases by Department:**\n\n| Department | Example Use Cases | Typical Impact |\n|------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **HR / People Ops** | Onboarding automation, offboarding workflows, documentation requests, performance review prep | 5+ hours saved per hire/exit |\n| **Finance / Accounting** | Payroll data entry, spreadsheet ETL, invoice processing | Eliminate manual re-keying |\n| **Marketing / Biz Dev** | Lead enrichment, campaign reporting, client communication triggers | No lead left behind |\n| **Account Management** | Client status updates, handoff summaries, feedback collection | Happier clients, less admin |\n| **Operations** | Work intake tracking, cross-team notifications, reporting dashboards | Single source of truth |\n\n**Question for the room:** \"What's the most manual, repetitive process in your department?\"\n\n*Detailed slides for each department available in appendix if anyone wants to dive deeper.*\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 9: The Pattern\n\n**Every department has the same story:**\n\n```\nManual Process → Human Error Risk → Staff Time Wasted → Opportunity Cost\n       ↓\n   Automation\n       ↓\nConsistent Process → Fewer Errors → Time for Value-Add Work → Growth Enabled\n```\n\n**What AutomateFlow does:** Connects your systems so data flows automatically, people get notified when they need to act, and manual handoffs disappear.\n\n---\n\n## THE ASK\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 10: What We're NOT Asking\n\n- We're NOT asking for a purchasing decision today\n- We're NOT asking for budget approval\n- We're NOT asking you to commit to a timeline\n- We're NOT asking you to change how you work tomorrow\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 11: What We ARE Asking\n\n**Three things:**\n\n1. **Tell us your pain points**\n   What's the most manual, frustrating process in your department?\n\n2. **Let us learn**\n   Can we schedule 30-minute discovery sessions with each department lead to understand your workflows?\n\n3. **Surface blockers now**\n   If there's a reason this wouldn't work for Eastpoint Capital, we want to know today — not after we've invested more time.\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 12: Questions for Leadership\n\n**For [Owner - Dad]:**\nYou've built Louisiana's largest collection firm. What would it mean to have systems that protect that legacy and scale with growth?\n\n**For [Owner - Son]:**\nWhat's the biggest operational bottleneck you see across departments?\n\n**For Department Leads:**\nWhat's one process you wish you could automate tomorrow?\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 13: Next Steps\n\n| When | What | Who |\n|------|------|-----|\n| Today | Agree on discovery approach | All |\n| This week | Schedule 30-min sessions with interested department leads | Alex + Charles to coordinate |\n| February | ROI summary by department | Alex |\n| February | Consolidated proposal for leadership review | Alex + Trisha |\n\n---\n\n### SLIDE 14: Thank You\n\n**Alex Obleton**\nAccount Executive, AutomateFlow\nuser@user\n\n**Kurt [Last Name]**\nIn-House Counsel, AutomateFlow\nuser@user\n\n**Charles Daniel**\nYour internal champion who made this partnership possible\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Backup Slides\n\n### If asked about implementation timeline:\n\"Typical implementations take 60-90 days for Phase 1, with ongoing expansion. Charles and I have already started building — we're not starting from zero.\"\n\n### If asked about security/compliance:\n- SOC 2 Type II certified\n- SAML SSO for enterprise authentication\n- SCIM provisioning for user management\n- Data encryption in transit and at rest\n- GDPR and CCPA compliant\n- \"We can have a dedicated conversation with your IT/security team\"\n\n### If asked about legal industry experience:\n\"AutomateFlow works with law firms of all sizes.

      "content": "Eastpoint Capital - Enterprise Opportunity (Legal Operations Automation)\n\nLouisiana's largest collection law firm evaluating AutomateFlow for operations automation. E-filing mandate (live Jan 1) forcing modernization. Tuesday 2pm managers meeting with all department leads + both owners — first direct access to economic buyers. Champion has mapped 10+ use cases worth ~$230K/year. Land-and-expand path to $50K+ ARR.\n\nSalesCloud Deal: https://example.com/...\n\nRecent Gong Call: https://example.com/...\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nLouisiana's largest collection law firm (~60 employees, multiple departments)\n\n~300 suits filed per day across Louisiana courts\n\nE-filing mandate went live Jan 1 — forcing process change whether they want it or not\n\nCurrent state: CLS (case management) → manual spreadsheet → PandaDoc → Word → print → sign → scan → file\n\nDedicated staff handle rejects/errors full-time; 3+ person printing team\n\nContacts\n\nTrisha Frederic - CFO. Champion. Hired by the dad (owner), building influence. Has personal pain (payroll manual entry). Previous proposal (TriNet) got rejected by owners — motivated to win this one.\n\nCharles Daniel - Developer/IT Lead. Champion. Hands-on builder, James implement. Hired to drive modernization. Got us the Tuesday managers meeting invite. Direct quote: \"CLS to PandaDoc automation would be huge.\"\n\nOwner (Dad) - Partner. Neutral/convinceable. Sees the future, but protective of what he built. Hired Trisha. Framing: \"You built something worth protecting. This is how we protect it.\"\n\nOwner (Son) - Partner. Skeptical. Managing firm ~5-6 years. \"Family business works, why change?\" Framing: Taking on this project = setting team up for success, not admission of failure.\n\nDecision process: Father-son owners FlowBuilder final call. Meeting them Tuesday for first time. Trisha/Charles building the case, owners approve. Unknown if Trisha has signing authority up to a threshold.\n\nWhat they're trying to solve\n\nUse Case 1: CLS → PandaDoc Document Automation\n\nProblem: Staff manually collating case info from CLS into spreadsheets, uploading to PandaDoc, positioning signatures\n\nWorkflow: CLS webhook → extract case data → generate PandaDoc document → route for signature → file\n\nROI: 60 hrs/month saved × $40/hr = $20-50K/year\n\nUse Case 2: Demand Letter Automation\n\nProblem: 100+ demand letters per month assembled manually\n\nWorkflow: Trigger from CLS → generate letter → review queue → send\n\nROI: 100 hrs/month × $40/hr = $20-50K/year\n\nUse Cases 3-10: Mapped but need discovery\n\nDocument review routing, signature workflows, filing deadline tracker, iPerform integration, LexisNexis scrubs, metrics dashboard, accounting ETL, Power Automate migration, payroll automation.\n\nCombined ROI: ~$230K/year ($155K time savings + $75K risk reduction). Need to validate with each department head — that's what Tuesday is for.\n\nCurrent state\n\nPlan: None - net new logo\n\nExisting automation: Power Automate (manual trigger flows, no error alerting)\n\nTech stack: CLS (Verdacan - case management), PandaDoc, iPerform (court filing), LexisNexis\n\nAutomation experience: Charles is technical and can build/maintain. Trisha learning.\n\nWhat they care about\n\nE-filing compliance → They're already under the mandate, dealing with rejects daily\n\nStaff capacity → \"Every department has heavy lifts they're manually doing\" - Charles\n\nClient onboarding bottleneck → Growth is limited by manual intake capacity\n\nRisk reduction → Missed deadlines, filing errors have real cost\n\nOwner buy-in → Champions need to build airtight case before asking for budget\n\nDeal sizing\n\nInitial target: ~$50K ARR\n\nEnterprise platform with Teams tier\n\nTAM hours for Q1-Q2 buildout\n\nCLS integration as anchor use case\n\nExpand path:\n\nEach department head has use cases → department-by-department expansion\n\nPower Automate migration opportunity\n\nMulti-year deal once value proven\n\nTimeline\n\nDec 29 - Initial call with Trisha ✅\n\nDec 30 - Technical deep-dive with Charles, mapped 10+ use cases ✅\n\nJan 5 - Build session: webhook → PandaDoc working ✅\n\nJan 11 - In-person with Trisha (Baton Rouge), got owner intel ✅\n\nJan 16 - Strategy session with Charles, got managers meeting invite ✅\n\nJan 21 (Tue 2pm) - MANAGERS MEETING: all dept leads + owners\n\nJan 21+ - Schedule discovery sessions with each department head\n\nFebruary - ROI by department → consolidated enterprise proposal\n\nQ2 2026 - Target contract signature\n\nCompetitive situation\n\nPower Automate - Currently in use. \"Manual trigger\" flows that aren't truly automated. No error alerting. Position as complement: AutomateFlow adds reliability layer + failure notifications.\n\nStatus quo - Not really an option. E-filing mandate already changed their world. They're dealing with rejects and new processes whether they automate or not.\n\nOur angle: The mandate forced change. Question isn't \"should we modernize\" but \"since we have to change, should we do it piecemeal or build a foundation?\" AutomateFlow = foundation.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nEarly owner exposure → First time meeting economic buyers. If demo doesn't land or they don't see relevance, could lose momentum. Mitigated by: Kurt (in-house counsel) presenting legal-specific content, concrete demos not just vision.\n\n\"See current process working first\" objection → This killed TriNet proposal. Counter: e-filing already changed the process — we're helping them respond to forced change, not asking them to abandon something that works.\n\nCLS API unknown → Need to validate webhook/database access. Charles checking with Verdacan. If no API, adds complexity.\n\nDecision timeline unclear → Don't know owner budget thresholds or approval process. James surface in discovery.\n\nWhy we win this\n\nExternal forcing function - E-filing mandate means they MUST change. We're positioned as the smart way to respond.\n\nStrong internal champions - Both CFO and IT lead actively selling internally. Charles got us the managers meeting.\n\nAlready building with us - Working prototype exists (webhook → PandaDoc). Not starting from zero.\n\nROI is compelling - $230K annual value against ~$50K investment = 4.6x payback.\n\nLand-and-expand clear - Every department has pain. Tuesday meeting surfaces all of them.\n\nResources needed\n\nKurt availability Tuesday 2pm CT - In-house counsel to present legal \"art of the possible\". Speaks their language, builds credibility with legal-heavy audience.\n\nSA support post-Tuesday - If discovery sessions happen, James need SA for deeper technical scoping on CLS integration.\n\nBottom line\n\nTuesday is the critical moment. First time meeting the owners, first time presenting to all department heads. If we nail this, we get discovery access to every department and build a comprehensive $50K+ case. Strong champions, external forcing function (e-filing), working prototype already built. Risk is early exposure to skeptical owners — mitigating with Kurt on the call and concrete demos, not just vision. This is a \"show, don't tell\" moment.",

Quick summary of what I took away and next steps.\n\n\n\nWhat We Heard\n\n\n\nImport/Export File Processing (Top Priority) — FTP automation failing 3-4 times per week. Files either not importing at all or not moving to the right location. Creates distrust and requires daily manual verification. Same issues on exports — files created but not moved, or not created at all. Goal: reliable, out-of-sight automation with alerts only when something breaks.\n\nMedia Movement & Processing — 500-1,000 pieces of media per day need to flow to clients. Current process: manually pull from Paper Vision → rename using PowerShell/Excel macros → move to correct folders → zip → place in FTP. Clients are complaining about delays and saying competitors have this automated.\n\nMissing Media Tracking — When you request specific media for legal filings, it comes back in massive batches with no easy way to track whether you received what you asked for. Currently requires checking multiple spreadsheets and manually searching Paper Vision. ~1 hour/day on this, and it's still backed up. This is holding up demand letters and delaying revenue.\n\n\n\nFuture Phases (once priorities are solved):\n\nAffidavit automation (requires template cleanup on your side first)\n\nReporting dashboards — placement tracking, bar graphs by client, suit progression visibility\n\nSalesCloud integration for productivity tracking beyond the address book\n\n\n\nWhat I Need From You\n\n\n\nSayde, you mentioned sending over some materials — this would be really helpful for scoping:\n\nScreenshots or examples of the spreadsheets you're currently using for tracking\n\nAny documentation on the current FTP/import/export automation (even if it's just notes on what it's supposed to do)\n\nIf possible, a sanitized sample of the file formats you're receiving/sending\n\n\n\nFeel free to redact anything sensitive — or let me know if an NDA would help and I'll get that sorted.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\n\nCharles and I are going to bring in a Solutions Architect from our team to start scoping the technical implementation. They specialize in exactly this kind of work — file processing, FTP integrations, document routing. Once I have the materials from you, we'll schedule a working session to map out the specifics.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, if other pain points come to mind, just shoot them over — I'll keep the list organized.\n\n\n\nGreat meeting you both. Looking forward to getting this moving.\n\n\n\nAlex",

      "content": "Eastpoint Capital x AutomateFlow Partnership Introduction Leadership Alignment Session | January 2026\n\nWHY WE'RE HERE Three Things That Matter 01 E-Filing Changed Everything The January mandate didn't just add a requirement - it revealed every manual process in your operation. You're adapting. We want to help you do it once, right. 02 Your Team Feels the Lift PandaDoc, CLS, spreadsheets, signatures - staff are stitching systems together by hand. Every manual step is a risk and a cost. 03 Protecting What You've Built Louisiana's largest collection firm didn't get there by accident. Automation isn't about replacing people - it's about letting your team focus on what drives value.\n\nPARTNERSHIP TIMELINE What We've Built Together Dec 29 Initial conversation with Trisha Dec 30 Technical deep-dive with Charles - mapped 10+ use cases Jan 5 Built working prototype: webhook to PandaDoc document creation Jan 11 Strategy session with Trisha (Baton Rouge) Jan 16 ROI framework review with Charles Jan 21 Today: Introduction to leadership team \"CLS to PandaDoc automation would be huge. Staff are doing a heavy lift right now to collate information and position signatures.\" Charles Daniel We're not starting from scratch. Charles and the team have been building with us since December.\n\nTHE PLATFORM What is AutomateFlow? The Connector Between Your Systems 7,000+ app integrations - CLS, PandaDoc, Outlook, TeamChat, Excel, and more No code required - Business users can build and modify workflows Human-in-the-loop - Automation assists your team, doesn't replace judgment HOW DATA FLOWS CLS → AutomateFlow → PandaDoc → Filing 7,000+ App integrations Enterprise Security SOC 2 Type II certified, SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, data encryption in transit and at rest\n\nPROOF OF CONCEPT CLS to PandaDoc Automation The Problem Today Staff pull data from CLS (987 merge fields), format manually, paste into PandaDoc, position signatures - repeat for 300+ suits/day 1 Data comes in from source system (webhook) 2 AutomateFlow processes and formats the data 3 PandaDoc document created with correct field mapping 4 Ready for signature workflow and I-PERFORM e-filing Current State Manual data entry With Automation Documents in seconds This is Phase 1. Charles and I are still working on the upstream CLS connection - that's our next step together.\n\nUNDERSTANDING YOUR WORKFLOW Where Automation Fits 1 CLS Source of truth 987 merge fields → 2 AutomateFlow Orchestration Routing & validation → 3 PandaDoc Document generation E-signature workflows → 4 I-PERFORM E-filing to courts Provana platform The Heavy Lift Today Manual data collation from CLS to spreadsheets Copy-paste into PandaDoc, position signatures Print → Sign → Scan → Upload cycle Queue reports in Excel, manual distribution Files \"lost in the cracks\" between steps What AutomateFlow does: Connects these systems so data flows automatically, people get notified when they need to act, and nothing falls through the cracks. \"CLS → PandaDoc automation would be huge. Staff are doing a heavy lift right now to collate information and position signatures.\" — Charles Daniel\n\nLEGAL AUTOMATION Where Firms Like Yours Are Winning \"I'm Kurt, in-house counsel at AutomateFlow. I deal with the same document workflows, deadline pressures, and compliance requirements you do.\" 01 Document Assembly at Scale Demand letters, pleadings, standard filings - template-driven generation with data pulled automatically from case management. 300 suits/day x 5 min saved = 25 hrs/day 02 Deadline Management Court filing deadlines tracked automatically. Alerts before deadlines hit, not after. Automatic escalation. Zero missed deadlines = zero malpractice exposure 03 Intake and Triage New matters classified by type, urgency, jurisdiction. Routed to the right queue based on the 2-digit LAM code from CLS. Less sorting, more substantive work 04 Client Communication Status updates triggered at case milestones. Template responses for common inquiries. Nothing falls through the cracks Kurt’s Thoughts The firms winning aren't just adding technology - they're removing friction from every step.\n\nLEGAL AUTOMATION Legal Use Cases Summary Use Case What It Does Impact Demand Letter Automation 987 CLS fields auto-populate PandaDoc templates with Reg F compliance, ready for 5+30 day tracking Hours/day saved Filing Deadline Tracker Automatic monitoring with alerts before deadlines approach Zero missed deadlines Document Review Routing Rules-based routing to LAM queues, attorneys get notifications for meaningful review No files \"lost in cracks\" I-PERFORM Court Filing Automated data prep and submission to Provana e-filing platform No manual uploads LexisNexis Batch Processing Consumer scrubs run automatically, results formatted and delivered Free up research staff\n\nSECURITY & COMPLIANCE No AI-Generated Content We understand your client requirements. Here's how we handle it. YOUR CONSTRAINT \"AI-generated content may violate certain client requirements, so we need to avoid any AI-driven document generation or decisioning.\" 01 Orchestration, Not Generation AutomateFlow moves data between systems. Documents are generated by PandaDoc using your CLS templates - no AI writes content. 02 Routing, Not Decisioning Automation routes files to the right queue. Attorneys FlowBuilder all legal decisions - meaningful review stays human. 03 Your Data Stays Yours No training on your data. No sending PII to external AI models. Data flows through encrypted connections you control. What We're Automating Data sync between CLS and PandaDoc Queue notifications and routing Deadline tracking and alerts File transfer to I-PERFORM Status updates to clients\n\nYOUR ORGANIZATION Six Departments, One Workflow We've learned how work flows across your teams. Each department has specific pain points automation can address. Department What You Do Pain Points We Heard Automation Opportunity Client Services Placements, media gathering, demand letters, Reg F compliance \"Calculator for math\" - manual validation Auto-validation, workflow triggers LAMs Suits, judgments, garnishments, skip tracing, document prep Manual queue reports, files \"lost in the cracks\" Queue automation, status tracking Hearing (Attorneys) Meaningful review, court appearances, legal oversight \"Printing, signing, scanning back in\" Digital review workflow Document Team Mail sorting, scanning, CLS templates, queue distribution Manual sorting by queue number, physical delivery Digital routing, auto-assignment Accounting Check cutting, payments, garnishment processing \"Typing garnishments - hundreds of thousands, half his day\" Data extraction, auto-posting IT Power Automate, WinAutomation, CLS integrations, scrubs Legacy jobs, 2.5hr exports, SFTP cipher issues Modern orchestration layer Which of these pain points costs you the most time today?\n\nTHE INSIGHT Every Department Has the Same Story Manual Process → Human Error Risk → Staff Time Wasted → Opportunity Cost ↓ Automation ↓ Consistent Process → Fewer Errors → Value-Add Work → Growth Enabled What AutomateFlow does: Connects your systems so data flows automatically, people get notified when they need to act, and manual handoffs disappear.\n\nTHE ASK What We're NOT Asking X We're NOT asking for a purchasing decision today X We're NOT asking for budget approval X We're NOT asking you to commit to a timeline X We're NOT asking you to change how you work tomorrow\n\nTHE ASK What We ARE Asking 01 Tell Us Your Pain Points What's the most manual, frustrating process in your department? 02 Let Us Learn Can we schedule 30-minute discovery sessions with each department lead to understand your workflows? 03 Surface Blockers Now If there's a reason this wouldn't work for Eastpoint Capital, we want to know today - not after we've invested more time.\n\nDISCUSSION Questions for Leadership FOR THE OWNERS You've built Louisiana's largest collection firm. What would it mean to have systems that protect that legacy and scale with growth? FOR LEADERSHIP What's the biggest operational bottleneck you see across departments? FOR DEPARTMENT LEADS What's one process you wish you could automate tomorrow?\n\nPATH FORWARD Next Steps When What Who Today Agree on discovery approach All This Week Schedule 30-min sessions with interested department leads Alex + Charles to coordinate February ROI summary by department Alex February Consolidated proposal for leadership review Alex + Trisha\n\nQuestions? Thank you for your time today. Alex Obleton Account Executive, AutomateFlow user@user Kurt In-House Counsel, AutomateFlow YOUR INTERNAL CHAMPION Charles Daniel Who made this partnership possible",

Files either don't import, import partially, or don't move to proper locations. Same issues on exports. Need reliable automation with failure alerting.\n\n2) Media Movement: 500-1,000 PDF documents per day need to flow from Paper Vision (document storage) to clients via FTP. Currently manual: pull docs → rename via PowerShell/Excel → move to folders → zip → upload. Clients complaining about delays vs. competitors.\n\nExternal Team Owning\n\nClient Services (Sayde Whitaker, Kurt)\n\nApps in Use\n\nCLS (debt collection software), Paper Vision (document storage), FTP servers, Excel/PowerShell (manual macros), SalesCloud (currently just address book), potentially PandaDoc\n\nCustomer End Goal\n\nReliable import/export file processing with zero daily oversight (alert-only on failure). Streamlined media movement to eliminate client complaints about delays and match competitor automation levels.\n\nUse Case Impact\n\n• Currently ~1 hour/day on manual media tracking (still backed up)\n• 3-4 file transfer failures per week requiring manual intervention\n• Clients (Track, Midland) complaining 'why haven't y'all automated this yet?'\n• Demand letters delayed 3-4 weeks, holding up revenue\n• 500-1,000 docs/day manual processing\n\nGong Link\n\nN/A — Call recorded via NoteFlow AI: https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/f2ba6cbf-ff45-4010-bf35-4004f91d9371\n\nFlags/Risks\n\n• Financial services / debt collection industry\n• CRITICAL: No AI-generated content — client requirements prohibit AI in legal documents. Position as orchestration/routing only.\n• Legacy systems (CLS, Paper Vision) — may need custom API work\n• Previous automation attempts (Power Automate) have failed\n\nNext Step for SA\n\nInitial discovery call with Client Services team to scope technical requirements\n\nNext Call Scheduled?\n\nNo — waiting on customer to send screenshots/documentation of current spreadsheets and processes\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n• Louisiana's largest collection law firm (~300 suits/day)\n• $50K Enterprise deal, New Business\n• Strong champion (Charles Daniel, IT Lead) + engaged owners after managers meeting\n• Priority order: (1) Import/export reliability, (2) Media movement. Future phases include affidavit automation and reporting dashboards.\n• Customer explicitly compared to competitors who 'already have this automated'\n• Parallel testing approach landed well — they want to run in tandem before switching\n\nDeal Context\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nEastpoint Capital\n\nIndustry\n\nFinancial Services (Debt Collection Law Firm)\n\nARR\n\n$50-100K\n\nDeal Type\n\nNew Business\n\nStage\n\nLeadership Buy-In → Reference Validation",

Link: Google Drive\n\nWhat We Updated Based on Your Materials\n\nYour Six Departments — Replaced the generic \"Beyond Legal\" slide with your actual teams: Client Services, LAMs, Hearing/Attorneys, Document Team, Accounting, and IT. Each now shows the specific pain points we heard.\n\nYour Workflow Architecture — Added a new slide showing CLS → AutomateFlow → PandaDoc → I-PERFORM. This came directly from your email about the Provana integration.\n\nNo AI-Generated Content — Created a dedicated slide addressing this constraint head-on. Framing: AutomateFlow = orchestration and routing, NOT AI document generation. Attorneys maintain meaningful review. Data flows, humans decide.\n\nUpdated All References — Removed any \"AI classifies\" language from use case slides. Updated to \"rules-based routing\" and \"LAM queue codes.\" Added specific details like 987 merge fields, Reg F compliance, 5+30 day tracking.\n\nQuotes We're Using From Your Team\n\nWe pulled these from the recordings you shared — they show we've done the homework:\n\nOn manual math: \"I've actually still found a calculator that had stayed in my office when I first came here\"\n\nOn attorney workflow: \"Crazy lawyers... printing this stuff out, signing it, notarizing it and scanning it back in\"\n\nOn files getting lost: \"It just gets lost in the cracks and we'll just find it later\"\n\nOn the desired state: \"Almost like a DocuSign where DocuSign says review here, review here, review here. If all that's good, sign and then it moves on\"\n\nOn garnishments: \"Typing garnishments — hundreds of thousands, takes up half his day\"\n\nKey Positioning for Tuesday\n\nAutomateFlow is the orchestration layer — data moves, people get notified, nothing falls through the cracks\n\nWe complement your existing stack (CLS, PandaDoc, I-PERFORM) — we don't replace it\n\nZero AI document generation — attorneys keep meaningful review\n\nLet me know if you want to walk through any of this before Tuesday, or if there's anything you want adjusted.\n\nAlex",

      "content": "Subject: Eastpoint Capital + AutomateFlow — how we plan to prove value\n\nMr. Eastpoint,\n\nI'm Kurt, legal counsel at AutomateFlow. I joined your managers' meeting last month and have been working alongside Charles and your team since. I wanted to give you a direct update on where things stand.\n\nWhat your team has shown us:\n\nYour firm handles 17,000 of 21,000 state filings — 81% market share — processing 300+ suits a day. That volume demands infrastructure that runs reliably without depending on any single person. Right now, when an automation fails, Justin is the only one who can fix it. When a client changes their file format, it takes weeks of testing. When the firm brings on a new client, it means building custom automations from scratch. That's the constraint on growth, and it's what we want to help solve.\n\nHow we'll prove it:\n\nRather than ask you to take our word for it, we're building on your actual systems. Starting next week, our solutions architect Jordan Floyd is working directly with Charles and Justin to build real automations using your files, your processes, and your data. Within two to three weeks, we'll have working use cases you can see running alongside your current process — before and after, same data, clear difference.\n\nSpecifically, we're starting with:\n\nAutomated file transfer monitoring — so your team knows immediately when something fails, instead of finding out days later when a client calls\n\nDocument workflow integration — connecting your CLS output through PandaDoc to e-filing, reducing the manual steps that slow every suit down\n\nWhy we're confident:\n\nCorey McCray, the longtime administrator of your Word merge system, validated our technical approach. Your department heads have identified 10+ processes worth an estimated $100K+ in annual efficiency gains. But more importantly, this is about giving your firm the infrastructure to grow — bringing on new clients without weeks of custom setup, and keeping operations running whether Justin is in the office or not.\n\nOn the question of references:\n\nYou asked to hear from similar firms, and I want to be straightforward — we don't have an enterprise customer doing exactly what Eastpoint Capital does. Collection law at your scale is unique. Rather than offer a reference that doesn't quite fit, we'd rather prove it on your systems with your team's validation. We think the results James speak louder than any reference call.\n\nWhat I'd ask:\n\nGive us the next two to three weeks to build alongside your team. Once we have working use cases to show, I'd welcome the chance to walk you through what we've built and discuss whether this is the right path forward for the firm.\n\nRegards,\n\nKurt\n\nLegal Counsel, AutomateFlow",

Pain points quoted: \"calculator for math,\" \"printing, signing, scanning back in,\" garnishments \"takes half his day\" Automation discussion: Power Automate + WinAutomation stack, CLS exports take 2.5 hours, technical debt with Access/VBA **Updated presentation with Eastpoint-specific content**: Replaced generic slide08 with their 6 actual departments and quoted pain points Added slide05b: Workflow architecture (CLS → AutomateFlow → PandaDoc → I-PERFORM) Added slide07b: \"No AI-Generated Content\" slide addressing their constraint head-on **Key insight for Tuesday**: Position AutomateFlow as orchestration layer that moves data and routes work — NOT AI that generates content or makes decisions. Attorneys keep meaningful review.. Managers meeting — presented to ~10 department leads + both owners **Owners engaged**: Dad asked directly for customer references. Wants to talk to 3-4 debt collection law firms using AutomateFlow. Quote: \"I don't want to talk to a medical supply guy. I want to talk to somebody that does what we do.\" **Pain points confirmed live**: LAMs: Skip tracing document compilation most time-consuming — pulling docs from multiple areas for court filings Client Services: Track & Midland clients complaining \"why haven't y'all automated this yet?\" Accounting: Nick's manual Access database process flagged as automation candidate Document Team: Some folder renaming/moving, but less urgent **Kurt (AutomateFlow counsel) added value**: Spoke to legal-specific workflows, mentioned we have at least one similar firm **Parallel testing approach landed well**: \"Run in tandem before flipping any switches\" — addresses their change-aversion **Gating item identified**: References from similar firms. Dad was clear this is what he needs before he can \"ask intelligent questions\" **Next steps**: Deliver customer references: Rozas Law (Arvy's account, LA-based — the firm Kurt flagged) + deal support request for 2-3 additional legal customers Schedule department discovery sessions: Client Services and LAMs priority Research competitive landscape: How many collection firms use AutomateFlow vs. alternatives?. (evening)**: Reference outreach prep Arvy confirmed Matt Rozas at Rozas Law is good to reach out to — \"totally chill dude,\" in good hands with Erika post-sale Both firms are Baton Rouge-based — possible they already know each other Drafted outreach to Matt: check in on experience + ask about reference call with Eastpoint Capital Sending tomorrow morning via shared TeamChat channel",

Haven't gotten much done due to holidays and competing priorities. Can't help right now. **Rozas Law status**: Arvy made intro in shared TeamChat channel - Matt hasn't responded yet. **Next step: Send email directly.** Also sent note to Charles asking if Eastpoint has existing connection to Rozas (both Baton Rouge law firms) - warmer path if they already know each other. **Parallel play**: Broadening search to GTM team for \"high-volume legal intake\" or \"document-heavy operations\" patterns - exact vertical match may not be required if we can show similar operational patterns. **Risk assessment**: Dad wants to feel he can trust us. Similar companies (even if not exact match) might work if he can empathize with their situation. Could also be a hard no. TBD. **Mitigation**: Continue technical validation with Charles - tangible progress on CLS → PandaDoc builds credibility while we search.. SA intro call with Mike Stafford Walked Mike through deal context, timeline, and current state **Hypothesis on technical validation**: Two use cases to prove out — (1) CLS → PandaDoc API workflow they're stuck on, (2) e-filing integration Mike to review deal context and advise on order of operations Noted Charles is more coach than champion (invested but may lack authority) Still waiting on Sayde's screenshots/technical details before scheduling working session with Mike + Charles References remain the other gating item. Client Services deep-dive with Sayde Whitaker and Kurt **Attendees**: Sayde (user@user), Kurt, Charles (user@user) **Key pain points confirmed with specifics**: 1. **Import/Export File Processing (TOP PRIORITY)**: FTP automation failing 3-4 times/week. Files not importing or not moving to correct locations. Creates distrust, requires daily manual verification. Same issues on exports. Goal: \"out of sight, out of mind\" with alerts only on failure. 2. **Media Movement**: 500-1,000 docs/day to clients. Manual process: Paper Vision → rename (PowerShell/Excel) → move to folders → zip → FTP. Clients complaining about delays, say competitors have this automated. 3. **Missing Media Tracking**: Legal filings require specific media, comes back in massive batches. No way to track if requested items received. ~1 hour/day manual checking across multiple spreadsheets, still backed up. Holding up demand letters 3-4 weeks, delaying revenue. **Future phases** (require internal cleanup first): Affidavit automation, reporting dashboards, SalesCloud integration **Technical context**: CLS (collection software), Paper Vision (doc storage), FTP servers, Excel/PowerShell macros **Next steps**: Sayde to send screenshots of current spreadsheets and processes SA request submitted to bring in technical support for scoping Schedule working session once materials received **Deal advancement**: Use cases now concrete enough to warrant SA engagement.

Draw a line in the sand. **New approach**: Have Kurt (AutomateFlow counsel) send direct message to Mr. Eastpoint acknowledging we couldn't deliver legal-specific references, but pivoting to internal validation (Charles, Corey, dept heads all confirmed the approach works). **The ask**: Is internal validation enough to move forward, or is a perfect industry match a hard requirement? Binary choice — yes or no. **Why Kurt**: Counsel-to-counsel feels like a straight conversation, not sales pressure. Kurt was in the managers meeting and added value. **Next step**: Preview email with Charles first — get his read on how dad James receive it, any adjustments needed. Then Kurt sends.
