I just FlowBuilder you guys all wait as a power trip. Makes. Makes me feel powerful.  \nMe: Whatever you need.  \nThem: Oh, come on. You guys supposed to laugh at it. Now for you, like? Sounds about right. Good. Good seeing all you guys.  \nMe: To see.  \nThem: All right. Any. Okay. Anybody? Anybody do anything great yesterday? Amazing. Exciting. Were people off. I was just driving. I was skiing all weekend. So. But yeah, Saturday and Sunday were fun. Not skiing, but yeah, Monday was just like a six hour drive. Not the best, but all good. Jon, you were off now. Yeah, I still did some work, but Margot is home from school, so double doubling as a parent and trying to work. Alex was slacking me at 3:44am. Sunday morning, Saturday night. I sent him a note at like 12pm too, or 12 at midnight. And then he responded like 3:44. I was like, what is happening?  \nMe: No, I just woke up and saw it, so I was like, let me respond. To this. I was not just up that entire time working. I'm not that crazy.  \nThem: Well, I'm also sorry because, like, damn, like, I would, I would not want to respond to me respond to anybody at three something in the morning. They definitely did not have to. So I probably can get better about scheduling my messages too, so. All right. I know we have Robert here. Not sure if RV is going to come. It's just midnight for him. He said he might take some time back. I'm going to go ahead and drop the deal review link on here. But I wanted to touch one subject real quick. So Jon and I were going through this. I know you guys have, like, a ton of, like, you guys James have a ton of leads to work through, but as we're thinking about pipe gen, I have been more, like, trying to get more into the weeds. Think about, like, hey, what are different ways that we can go ahead and drive? Does anybody here remember the list that Justin sent out where it included all the. What's it called? It was. It had, like, the MRR spend in the account list. I know what you're referring to. I might be able to take that up. Okay? I James.  \nMe: Is that different from the daily ARR dashboard, right?  \nThem: Yes, yes.  \nMe: That's not the fdl dashboard. Yeah, okay.  \nThem: Yeah, I'm going to share my screen. I know this, like, drives me up a wall when somebody else does it to me, but it's do as I. Not do. Do as I say. Maybe. Yeah, one of those. But I. I was actually running through this with Jon today, so. Usually I go to companies. Robert, I know you had the question that you asked. I don't really know the answer to it. But I think one of the ones that we have here is. This company pro upsell. Maybe it's test audience. I think this had a filter in it, by the way, that it showed no one. The. Yeah, so it's this one. I've gone ahead and. Well, first got rid of me. Domain company size. This could so a lot of things can change. Here. I James probably just get a new report out for you guys once I have the other one going for 250 to 999. Essentially, I've just gotten rid of all of these. Things. Real estate. I know. Nobody lets them, so. Alex, I'm just going to pick on you. Because I see you.  \nMe: Let's do it.  \nThem: Got to remove the company owner is unowned. So essentially what I'm doing is like, one of the things we could really think about is what are these lists that you guys have where there are already companies that you own? A lot of them have already come inbound at a certain point. Where a few things you could look at is like account TLU, like more than 70% last month. That's one thing you can look at. So you can just go ahead and. Filter by that. So it essentially shows all of those customers that are going above 70% or has one account. A few other things that, like, Jon and I were looking at is count of, like, let's just start, like, top down with, like, the highest intent ones. I'll. I'll get the one with the mrr. But, for example, these are probably like four really good leads, right? So, I mean, these nano nets, for example, has 166 free accounts. It has two Teams accounts. So two Teams accounts. So that's four businesses that you have with teams accounts. That's a ton of free accounts that you're driving within the business. So that's one thing you could really look at. And this is probably an opportunity to actually use it more. I'm not going to use the word book of business, but I'm going to use it as like, hey, who's already in your account? And this is. And this is. Where, like, Charles, maybe you could give me this. Nikki person is just like, whenever I start typing LinkedIn, like, they just show up. Like, as, like, the first thing. So, like, it probably shows. Like, I looked at Nikki, like, 5,000 times in our sales navigator. Hopefully she doesn't think I'm a creep. Anyway. Neither here nor there. But one thing you could look at, Alex, is like, you could actually go in here, save. Save this business up if you need to. I think it's this, but this is probably not a great one, but let's just go to, like, nano nets. Maybe they're just, like, burning and churning. Free accounts. That would be hilarious if they're doing that. But let's look at nano nets here. So one of the things, like, Jon and I were just going through is. Nano nuts. And this is actually pretty good with, like, hey, what are their strategic priorities, right? Which might be market expansion, enterprise sales strategy, advanced document processing, and being able to go back to those customers and just use that as, like, a longer, longer plate. Right? Actually, see, like, when they've come in, Why they're starting the discussion. Really, you know, again, another opportunity to look at the team link connections. Right. So Jon Boyer, you could probably hit him up right now and say, hey, can you connect me with this person that you know? And being able to actually look at all of these folks. Reach out. Director of salesair. Yeah. Close to Brad Smith. Right. Like he's your internally quick way to just get connected, see if there's. See if there's something that we could drive as an Angela connected to the CEO. Like, lots of connections, it seems there being able to drive that and just understand. Okay, you have 166 free accounts, two teams accounts, hopefully. That's like, a signal enough to, like, go and start looking into these customers. And then for pro accounts, sometimes these are easier plays, sometimes they're not. But just being able to say, okay, you have two pro accounts, let's actually start migrating you over to teams accounts. Right? That's 25 users. There's no reason you shouldn't do that right now. At the size of and scale that you are at another, like, quick, like quick way to kind of have like a mini book of business that you guys can drive that really is intent based. So, again, all of these are, like, businesses that are in your name that probably have a lot of intent that you can go through. I am thinking of, like, what are different ways that somebody like Padma could actually help? Like, mind the right signals and get that. But I don't know if maybe I'll bring it. Up to the group. I don't know if you guys have a good way. I was trying to see if in Sales Navigator there was an option to essentially, like, add all of these and then look at, like, strategy. I don't know if anybody has done the, like, search through strategy and look at, like, AI back. Strategy as something that you look at, I think, because the list even I sent you guys doesn't have a ton of people that has a lot of pro or a lot of teens usage. I think going through them one by one is something that you can do, but. But it might be something that, that we look at. So open to suggestions if you have anybody has any. And secondly, just. Gut instincts on this play.  \nMe: Not necessarily suggestion, but I was going to ask, could you share? Or you may have, I may miss it. Could you share that table that you were just looking at? But in general, this, I think makes a ton of sense. Both of no, Vista was actually one I'd reached out to, basically running this play like mid October. November. So worth following up with again on that context. But I think we talked about this in one of our one on ones about a month ago just how to do this inbound for these types of accounts. So it sounds good. Like a good math.  \nThem: And I think one of the big things I saw from a lot of, like when I just ran through this list, Jon and I were talking about it actually in our one on one earlier today, is you might actually get surprised at some of these businesses where you actually say, like, oh, I haven't actually reached out to this person in a while. Right? Like, yeah, like, we reached out. Like, I don't really remember what happened. Like, November 6th was the last reach out we've done. It gives you another opportunity to, like, reach out to different folks in the business and try and re engage that person that you reached out to before, so. Hopefully this is kind of another way just if you're like when we're struggling and when we're just looking at inbound, we're really highly suggest like just get out of just there. And then these are ways to go ahead and drive pipelining your business. Cool. So I James get that report going so that one of them just has like a MRR number. That just helps. Because like one pro counter, one teams account could just be crazy amount of spend, right? Just, just through one account. Like, even if it's a pro deal, that's. It's kind of hard to see that right now. In that view, Jon and I went through some. Some of them is going to be a little bit of a dud. There's like, one person who was on a, like, company 1 million plan, and then they actually, like, downgraded to, like, a Pro 2K because they were like, we had no usage. And so that happened. I mean, maybe not the best people to reach out to. Like, you know, four weeks after they've done that, like, makes sense. And you guys are smart. But it's one of the things that Padma, like, I want PAMA to really focus on is, like, how do you actually get those signals for us to reach out? It's almost like FQLs, but a little different, right? Which is like, how many pro accounts, how many teams accounts? How do we actually FlowBuilder it so that when people do sign up for a teams account or a pro account in these accounts, that we can continue flagging it and bring it back to the business is something that I want to do. Alrighty. Any other questions before I get in? To it. Cool. Alex, I think you're going to take a big chunk of our time today, so I'm going to have you. Have you take us away on Eastpoint and on Horizon Ventures pioneering.  \nMe: Yeah, I think I would rather talk Horizon Ventures first because that's a bit more time sensitive. The only. I'll say quickly on Eastpoint. We're still, I think, relatively early stage there. I've engaged with the champion. Today is my first contact with the economic buyer buyers this afternoon and we're also meeting. The rest of their management team. So that should help me get an opportunity to go explore additional use cases beyond the initial core when I was brought in for. But we're still kind of building value case early state exploration there. What I would love to spend time talking about is actually kind of a similar to the conversation this morning is how should we be thinking about what services we provide to Horizon Ventures? And I would love this group's input on any opportunities to pull in the clothes.  \nThem: Perfect.  \nMe: So a little context. Originally, we were targeting this coming Friday as the close date, the 23rd. We had a check in last Friday with the CIO, the economic buyer, our champion and another senior executive in the IT Org. And we are going to. We sort of have not sort of. We got what I would call the technical win. Like, we went through all of the. These are the features the system needs. Does it do those things? The big one for them was bring your own model. The main question they had coming out of that, or at least my read of the main question they had coming out of that, was what does a support partnership look like? How do we go from hey, we were buying a bunch of Legos to you're helping us build a vision for the future, and that's what was originally had prompted me to pull together proposal that I James share with this group. Again prefacing with when a flag that this is not something we should replicate because I got pushback from this on the services team, but was trying to put together a proposal of like, hey, what does our partnership look like? What are the key. Pillars of our partnership. I actually think this is still good. I think we still start with something like this of, like, these are the core Dundas of our partnership together. And then we were able to get Francis, who's the TAM who's going to be taking over this account once we close it. He's going to be joining the Call Friday to helpfully talk through what in depth. They're sort of go forward support, looks like. But I think we're just gonna be. We're gonna be using our sort of existing one pager and having him talk to it. Okay. That's sort of all the high level context. And basically the key thing is because the cio, the VP in it, wanted to understand this services model. We're probably looking at first, second week of February to have this actually closed. Like, if we meet this Friday, they should have economic approval on this and then. Assuming they check off here, we have to start the actual procurement process. And they were not willing to get their legal team involved until they'd had sort of like a yes, we want to work with you guys. Check done on the partnership. I James pause there because I think that's one thing I would love to get this group's input on. What are some options or strategies that we might be able to use to. Accelerate their adoption or said differently, is there anything we could say in the call on Friday that would get them to say, okay, we actually need to get this done now instead of the week after? Sort of the traditional things I've considered. And Kyungho, like, raised like, hey, can we actually get some of their implementations? Turned on. I think we could do that. I don't know if that James actually drive a signature, though, but I think we can actually get some of this built for them, offering some trainings potentially on top of what they have, and then, of course, just showing the ROI case around. Hey, every week you're not doing this. You're losing money on these places where you have costs running.  \nThem: Have you. So we have these, like, department workshops included in this. It looks like. Have you scheduled a first one or talked about when they want to get, like, their first workshop with multiple users? On the books.  \nMe: No, we have not. I think that would be one potential. Sort of carrot that we can give here is like, hey, how do we actually get this initial workshop going? And the CIO actually was on the call, specifically said, like, he had tried AutomateFlow before, but got lost, and so ended up abandoning it. So I think that could be a way to, like, hey, let's. Get you some of these actual trainings up and running initially.  \nThem: I mean that I think that's one of the best ways just get momentum in the platform. That's not really the best way maybe to drive urgency on closing the deal. Unless they were like, hey, we want this to be scheduled on X date. You know, all of our key users are available. And then you can work backwards from that, of course, and just say, like, let's get your, you know, actual account set up. All the admin, like guardrail set up. If they're not pushing a hard date on that, maybe it won't help with the close date, but that's a really good opportunity, of course, just to, like, take that ciso. FlowBuilder him excited user and I think unlock a lot of other people who James become champions post sale but. Yeah, definitely. Curiously. See, whatever people think on, like, driving urgency for closing here. I guess not completely tied to that, but has the legal. I missed it? Did the legal team have decided like a review yet or recent across like the enterprise agreement?  \nMe: They were not James. The CIO was not willing to have the legal and procurement team start looking at the contract until they'd said, yes, we want to buy formally. So they have the agreement, but their legal team has not started like reviewing the agreement.  \nThem: Okay? Yeah, because that always takes a while, I guess.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: What's the.  \nMe: Sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: What's the future state that they need to get to?  \nMe: They need to get to a world where one, they have these initial use cases that we've laid out built for them, two, Sarah has the capability to knows how to build additional use cases that are relatively complex. And then three, they have sort of a base of citizen development where people at least are aware and informed of how to use AutomateFlow question of how far up the curve they get. But those are kind of the three things these three initiat use cases Sarah Upskilled system development broader across the org.  \nThem: And how many other people are using it right now. Platform.  \nMe: Using AutomateFlow right now? None. So literally, I would say no one. No one at this company is using AutomateFlow yet. As far as. Unless maybe there's. Unless there's like a free account somewhere that I'm not aware of, but there's no sort of central AutomateFlow usage. At this account at all.  \nThem: Got it. Was anybody up for, like, boot camps or running a session earlier? Or has it been like we're just going to wait on all of this before. Like, I'm trying to understand. Like, was Sarah getting the MVP up and going and working on that? The highest. Like their highest. Priority for. For now.  \nMe: Yes, I would say getting her up and running, that is the highest priority. We've not talked about the specific trainings yet, and that's actually why most of the team capability is in Q2, because I think for her, she's like, sure, we want to get people onboarded, but the most important thing for me is I get. I get these initial things built.  \nThem: What's the trade off if they. If they don't like? What's a trade off for Sarah if she doesn't get this in this month? Or is there one?  \nMe: Well, I think that's the bit. I think she's the main person that has the trade off for her. Basically, the longer you delay, that is more delays in actually getting these things up and running. So her mandate is to have trials of these things up and running by the end of March. And if we're not starting until mid February. That just becomes really hard to do with confidence because we haven't been in their systems yet. Like, we have the architecture that we're working towards, we haven't actually connected to in either systems. We haven't done any of the. Actually that's the main thing connecting to their systems, figuring out, like, sort of the unknown unknowns that happen once you hit any real IT system. I don't think full transparency. I think part of that is me trying to sort of build a sense of urgency. With our team. The way I understand our essays and TAMS work, I honestly think they could get it done in the time period that they have, but I don't necessarily want to. Frame it that way.  \nThem: What is. Yeah. I'm trying to figure out, like, does Sarah truly believe that she needs to get this up and running? Within March and like. Or maybe let me flip it around so this. Reads. Well, first of all, it's very pretty. I would never be able to FlowBuilder slides this pretty, so, you know, like a true consultant. Great job. Maybe this is where actually you could focus on the ROI first. Is what I was thinking. So actually say, like, hey, like, we understand that this is, like, what we're trying to do. This is a partnership, and we're already, like, scaling for, like, roi. Have that be the first discussion. And then have it inform like the year at a glance in front of you. I also think that. Here's like, this is where I meant by the AITP part, which is I would almost condense this down almost to Q1. Q2 and then, like, FlowBuilder the third and fourth be org rollout and then say, like, hey, Sarah, like, you can kind of decide or the team can decide what that rollout looks like with the TAM and the CSM team. You could even say, like, that could also be the part where you're starting to talk about aitp, right? I would almost like, condense this in a way to, like, say, hey, like, let's even say, like, the first month or two is on foundation, right? And then the second Q2 is about like, hey, let's figure out team capability. If you need, like, we can do a ton of programming, but that would need, like, you know, upgrading over to the AI transformation program. And right now, like, and this is, I guess the test for you is do you feel like you are hitting all the requirements? For the use of AutomateFlow in the next 12 months. And I think the answer, in my opinion, is yes. Already. With the ROI that you're driving like, we're pretty close to those use cases already. Is one of them already live or not yet? Out of the three. Okay?  \nMe: And this again. There's something we probably could do, but we have not pushed them to get us connected to their systems yet. Or not. We. I've not pushed them to get us connected to their systems yet.  \nThem: Y. Eah.  \nMe: On that.  \nThem: How about we could. I'm just trying to figure out, like, is there a way that we do that this week and then get to live next week? And that is the marker for signature. Because then you're already getting ROI on the system because they're concerned. Like, your big risk here is, like, if you present it as, like, a year in a glance, like, all of this are going to be like, great, that sounds great. Let's do this. Let's do a pilot for Foundation. See if it works or not.  \nMe: Makes sense. That does FlowBuilder sense.  \nThem: And then we can decide on Q2, Q3, Q4 after we do a 90 day pilot or 6 day pilot. And if you don't come in with, like, a strong point of view of, like. No, I actually think we're already there.  \nMe: That doesn't.  \nThem: Like, we're already at foundation right now. We're already building, like, and you don't run into, like, the Myriad360 issue, where, like, they won't connect. And then it's like, it's actually a ton more work to try and get a ton of your time. To try and get them live on a pilot. And you still introduce a lot of risk into your business or like for you, within that three months too.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay? I like that a lot. So play just playing back to FlowBuilder sure the structure instead of it. Instead of around like, hey, these are the service here to glance. Start with the ROI value as like the sort of basis of what we're driving towards. Like this year we're going to help you drive these two use cases in the first couple of months. Build that foundation with Jordan. Your essay in this next couple of months. We'll like get Sarah, get some this court of core group upskilled. If we're talking Q3, Q4, that's going to be broader rollout. But that's like we can have a discussion around whether that's an AI transformation or, like, something along that going forward. And then, I guess, and then sort of a separate thread of like, hey, if I can get with Sarah, like, today, tomorrow, or really, I guess, get Jordan to get with Sarah to, like, today, tomorrow to. Actually, can we turn some of these on. Can we get some of these connected so that we can go into the call with the CIO being like, hey, we've, like, gotten some actual progress here, and this is, like, what the value James look like for you.  \nThem: Yeah, I think about the highlights. I think about is it's 247k or I think that was a number in, like, savings that we're driving for your business. Like. We already see the value of like of AutomateFlow enterprise program like platform at. I think you're at 70k, 60 somethingk.  \nMe: I'm at, like, 80 my rolls. Okay. This is. This is actually also thing I want to talk to the group about 70 days, like, sort of what we have here is, like the base platform. Fee.  \nThem: I would FlowBuilder the enhanced support be opaque. That was one of the first things that when I saw that, I was like, I would just remove that and just say, hey, the Enterprise platform, what we're adding, like, giving you on the Enterprise platform is. And I would just go 12 hours of TAM, 600,000 tasks included, because you don't want to set. Yourself up for next year. They just go, oh, let's just take out the 10k or the 15.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: K.  \nMe: I guess. Maybe. How. How do you frame that as. If they ask what the breakdown? Because maybe this is a mistake on my part. I did tell them that we typically charge more for these TAM hours because my initial, like, price offer didn't include them. Sarah came back, she was like, hey, so we charge more for these. Yeah, I guess. How would you. How would you potentially position of like, if they ask, like, so what is, like, the base price of the platform? Here.  \nThem: Robert, you went off mute. Yeah, I'm in. My opinion is to keep this on as $10-20K for your hand support package. Personally because this is a big ask for them, and it's something that, you know, he's framed as an exception. It sounds like they already have an understanding of what are base prices without it. Part of me just likes the way this slide looks. And I think you're presenting it tomorrow, right? So.  \nMe: Yeah. I don't want to. This is. It's easy for me to change, and I've not, like, shared this with any of them. So, like, they've. They've not. No. No one on their side has anchored to this. And all I've shown Sarah is she has a quote that has the. Semi 9k number, but we had talked about the 69k number before she came back with a 10k.  \nThem: There. I mean, part of this, to me, just seems like an opportunity to say, you know, this is something that I've, like, gotten approval on as an exception. This is valid through the end of the month. This is something that, you know, once again, like, we don't really offer as a standard, but since it's so important to you all, I think she's very, like, aware that you've been going back and forth with the team to try to get approval for 12 hours at least. That's my understanding.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So this just seems like an opportunity to give in. The get in this case would simply be, can we FlowBuilder this happen within months? But I get that's just, like, kind of how I'm looking at it. I don't know. What appears to know what people think about that. Because I know, Kyungho, you're saying basically just like, let's keep this as opaque as possible, so. Yeah. Since you've already had that discussion, if I was in your shoes, what I would just do is I would probably just go. Or how does your deal Hopper look right now? What is it at? Is it at 55 plus 15?  \nMe: Deal. No, it's just. It's just. It's just 79.  \nThem: Okay, it's just 79, but the line item.  \nMe: Yeah. Wait. I can actually. I can pull up the. The quote. Let's see.  \nThem: So. Or we can go back. I guess that what I'm just trying to get to is, like, why not be at 69k for January? It's like, hey, you know what? Like, we're just going to go like we talked about it. We want to go 69k for January. The ROIs here. Like, I know we've presented something for 79K that's going to be active, like, you guys continue to have that. Just so you guys know, like, we're ready to get connected into your apps. We're at 240k in terms of value. We can talk about what org rollout looks like in the future as well. Like, because you have, like, room to play with. I would get rid of, like, the Q3, Q4 stuff. Just be like, hey, we'll figure that out as we go. We could just say, like, hey, like, we're happy to eat the cost at 69k for your first. Like, for your first year. If. If you guys sign for January Again, the 79k is still valid for. For after January.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: Like, I'm just thinking about, like, multiple ways to. Like, I think you should still do the Sarah one. And if I was in your shoes, I would. I'd rather have 69k coming in this month.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Maybe even less than that versus.  \nMe: I'm. I'm actually 100% open to that. The only thing I, I just, I wasn't sure if, like, the price was the limiting factor here. I guess if that makes sense. Like, in my mind, I didn't want to give away the 10k if that was fine, assuming we could like, FlowBuilder their answer here. But I think it also is very reasonable to say, hey, like, we have a strong ROI here. This James get you the support you need. And those, like, two months, like, we're talking about, like the six hour time frame, like, sort of the normal time that you get, because our argument the whole time has been like, we James support you to be successful. You don't need, like that extra level of commitment.  \nThem: How. Yeah. How I would frame is we're happy to eat the cost of 10k. In the future. And the reason why I say that is because next year, when you get to renewal and they're like, let's go down to six hours. You'll be like, there's nothing to go down on because I ate the cost last year.  \nMe: So is it. Do you think it would be too. Should, like, should. Should I do, like. Hey, this is like, the whole, like, list price dash out, like, then this is what we're giving you. Type thing where it's like, oh, this is typically 15k. We're just going to, like, eat that cost. And even better, like, that's actually. The list doesn't become 79k, it becomes. 85. And we're saying we'll give it to. We'll do 69, I think, is like a strong framing, potentially.  \nThem: Yeah, I think it's even fine to say, hey, list is 84. We're offering 79. Like February onwards. Like this engagement has like continued. And like every day we spend more of everybody's time. Like it costs us more money, right? But, like, as a business, we're open to going down to like, a 69K, like, product, like 69K platform. If you go ahead and. Yeah, we're open to 69k if you are signing in January. And that's a sign of, like, we want to take a lot of this cost. Up like we're just going to eat the cost of anand support just so you feel covered for the next year.  \nMe: And then just, like, tactical question, I think. I think this is still fine with what we got from Lens, but that's like 69k with 12 Tam hours, right? Is what you're. Okay, okay.  \nThem: Yep, yep. Exactly. Just be ready that, like, next year. So that's why I'm like, next year, when they're saying, oh, like, let's go down to six hours, you say, no, we ate the cost. It was a 79k product. We ate the cost. Like, there's no more room for me to really. Go down on, like, just keep 12 hours. Why wouldn't you?  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yeah. Okay? I, I really like that. I think, and I think, I think that James allow us to create as much urgency as possible. We'll see if like that if they, if they bite on it. But I think that.  \nThem: Y. Eah, yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it's that plus. I would almost be like, hey, we didn't have like. I think it's okay sometimes to say we didn't have enough confidence to figure out what Q3 and Q4 looks like. And for you, it's also a lot to figure out for 79K. What am I going to do for Q3 and Q4. So what we decided is, like, let's figure out Q3 and Q4. Like, as you get on the platform and for you, like, to support you getting on the platform, we're going to eat the cost of anand support, especially for January, because if not, we're all spending more. Resources, more time getting this deal through. But, like. And you can just ask Sarah directly on that call. Hey, Sarah, like, we've agreed that it's like a 240k. Like, there's ROI here, and that's just one workflow. We have multiple more workflows. That's. That's ready to go here. So. Yeah, that. That's where I would. Or that's what. I think. But open to the group. I would start at 79. If you think it's really pricing, this is a way to test that. And if we have the ability to offer 69, as you know, an offer for closing it in month, then great. And then a year from now, if they say, oh, we only want to do six hours, well, then you could say, we'll give you 12 hours at 69. Because, like, that's just what we want to continue at the level of engagement. I think that's still crazy. What if scenario. Ultimately, it's still more revenue for the business. And for both teams. And if this is already, like, a proposal that makes a ton of sense with the why we discounted, here's, like, all of our reasoning behind it. I think this is really, really strong. And if the CISO guys like it's the increase of 10k that's really keeping me skeptical more than anything. I think it's not an opportunity to go back to the finance team. We got for this in month, but even offering 79k in the same exact phrasing that you're saying Kyungho as like. We want to discount this. We want this partnership. This is why I reduce it by 5K. And it's like an in month offer as well. I mean. I just feel like that extra 10k is negotiating power that you may not need, but then have if it comes. That's. That's why.  \nMe: Yeah. Like, don't, don't frequently don't preemptively, like, set the bar lower. But be prepared to, like, in that conversation, depending on how they're reacting. Be like, okay, if they're, like, on the fence about this, like, what if we could do 69k this month? Like, would that be a meaningful difference type thing.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, especially if they ask for something directly, because if you start at 69 and then they ask for a discount, I feel like you're. You have less options. But I could be wrong there. And I don't know. I feel like the renewal concern is just interesting because they do have use cases scoped out. I think they have a pretty clear understanding of what they want to use those hours for, especially with some workshops in mind. But if you have heard from the TAM team, either of you, all that you know they're concerned about the ability to renew 12 hours. Then. I mean, I understand that as well. I. I think we're all saying the same thing, though. Alex already pitched 79K, just so everybody knows. So they all know it's 79K. The idea is that if on Friday, like this call on Friday, if you don't get to them with, hey, this is a price for January you're not getting to. And then you can decide, like, once that slips, like, you can decide how to play within that 10k is my view. Like, there needs to be strong enough incentive for it to be January. And if they're not starting procurement yet, like, you need a sprint starting Friday. If they say, like, sure, let's talk about it. And then on Monday they're like, sure, let's try to get this in on January. Like, that's still a sprint. That week. And that. That's why I'm like,  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: There's kind of this idea of, like, best and final. And, like, hey, if we slip January, great, like, the 79K is still there. And they'll probably be like, no, let's try to do 69k in February. And it's like, no, I really cannot do that. And. And then you. Go into. The other thing also for everybody is now's the time to start using RKO and summit.  \nMe: Eah. No.  \nThem: It's like, even if we sign now, like, you're going to push. Like. Like, I don't want to push back too much on the onboarding. It's kind of a fine line because then they'll be like, oh, let's just start afterwards so my enterprise plan doesn't start. Like, but it's something to just say, hey. Like, we just have a lot of businesses that's going to be wanting to go active afterwards, and we want to put you at the top of the list.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: For onboarding and getting people up and running. But.  \nMe: Okay. So that she's super clarifying things because I. I actually. I hadn't shared this with the CIO yet, so I would. But I think. I think it's like, hey. There's this page. Basically, like, this is what I like. You've probably heard from Sarah that the price is 79k. This is what base that price off. Based off of our conversations so far, I want to put a, like, best and final of 69 in front of you if we can get this done. This month to allow us to like because it's important to us to, like, drive all this value, blah, blah, blah. Cool. This is. I. I really like it. Yeah, I think that's. I think that's the. I think that's the main thing. I James. I'll definitely keep this group updated on how that actually goes. But, yeah, I love it.  \nThem: The one thing on also pricing support. I've had this happen one or two other times with tam. Is if they're smart, they're going to divide $10-20K. Divided by six times 12, it's like 140 bucks.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So they're going to be like, okay, so they're tons. 140 bucks. Like, why would I not get another consultant for 140 bucks an hour? That's like, external.  \nMe: Deming.  \nThem: Like it could be something.  \nMe: Around. Like the Vow. It's like you're. We're. We're effectively subsidizing it, right? Like that's. That's a subsidized price. Like the value you're getting is in the expertise. Like any third party expert James take time to ramp up on your account. We'll take time to wrap up on AutomateFlow and won't have the continuity next year when you need, like, whatever the fifth thing is that you're working on.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah, I. I think the concern is just. Yeah. Being able to just slash that off. Like, I mean, we saw that in few, like, Z goes and others where they just go, like, all right, let's just scratch that off. Let's just go for, like, 69K. I think in your instance, it might not be. That bad. Right? And. And I think you have the right phrasing, which is? Oh, yeah, nothing's going to change on the 69k if you take 12 hours or 6.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Like it's. It's still going to be 6, but next. Next month, though, it's going to be 79k. This month it's going to be 69 and.  \nMe: Y. Eah. And. Or next month, you can be 69 and six hours, but, like, you're not. You're not getting this specific deal this month. Yeah. Okay? That is great. I actually for eaten. I don't have a ton to discuss yet. The main thing is just like where I'm getting in front of the economic buyer. I.  \nThem: Alex, I am so sorry to interrupt. I was wondering, maybe just because we took a bit of time, do you mind if we pass? Well, we'll just pass after one. I was just. Yeah.  \nMe: Don't have.  \nThem: I took up a ton of time.  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: Charles, do you want to go on sva? There's not that much like essentially SVA they ran for last year. And I was working with one of the principal directors and special architect. They've actually both left. So I'm just trying to bring that on to life right now. So I spoke with one of the business analysts there. I was also, like, part of trial. And they've got a new principle coming in. So over the next couple of weeks, there's probably more to run through. I just sort of seen the decks and some recordings that we went through the team, so we don't have to repeat ourselves. But yeah, I can probably pass it on. There's not too much right now. It's just trying to sort of bring it back to life and then hopefully have an intro to the new sort of like principle running there program. But yeah, nothing too interesting here, so maybe someone else can FlowBuilder the use of the time. Cool. Maybe I expected that answer. So close. Dates at January 31st. And so what's the. Like, what's the plan? Back from it, I guess, is my question. Which is? I guess first, it's like the changing close date. But, like, how can we accelerate that? Or is this person even the right person? Like, at first I was like, this deal's super dead. But there's a little heartbeat. In this deal, I think because the person has come back. So. So that's positive. But I'm trying to figure out how we FlowBuilder up that gap. Yes. Yeah, I need to change the date. That's my bad. But yeah, essentially it's just when the new principles is getting ramped up on the AI Network program. So I chatted with the business analyst last week, and then she said she can do an intro the next two weeks, so I'll probably have an intro to the decision maker. Before, hopefully before kickoff. And then it's going to be more of like a February, potentially into March deal. But yeah. Need to get the intro done. I need to update my forecasting, so that's kind of on me. Definitely not January. I James do that now. Cool. And is Brian then you. So Brian's the president, so he actually runs the whole company. So I've met him once. I haven't actually. I don't know the name of the principal director who's taking over now. He's just been, like, put onto the steps. Hallway enablement program. Which is why they talk zap in the first place. And then the guy who's, like, running that running point on that left, and then the sort of boots on the ground arctic also left. So brought in new architects who also spoken with. I don't know who the principal is who's taking over yet. So that's probably introduced with two in two weeks. And Brian is the president, so hopefully once we've got like that chat with the director, Dunn, we can reconnect to him. But, yeah, essentially we don't have anyone manned on that project. Up until, like, now, which is why it's been quiet. But yeah. Lots to come, I think. Just looking at this from, like, 5,000ft. My only thing. The thing I was thinking is I wonder if you have an opportunity for Michael to reach out to Brian and just say, hey, is this still top priority for you? I know this person is getting up in ramped. Like, Charles has just kind of asked me around, like. Or I was asking Charles this week, like, hey, what happened to that SBA call? I talked to Brian. Just wanted to see, like, how this was on your priority and if you needed any support from me and just wanted to check if, like, Charles is doing a good job. Like, I do that a ton of times, or, like, asking a question like, hey, is your rep doing a good job, where usually they're like, oh, yeah, that's fine. Like, I'm just pushing this. But that's, in my opinion, what James get you enough signal to be like, am I just close lossing this deal? Am I like, when I'm pushing it? Because, like, what I hear too. Is like, hey, we're going to push it to February. Let's see. Versus, like, that's a quick way to get like, hey, where is this in your priority, Brian? And having Michael just ask that. And if he's like, oh, yeah, like, with the craziness, like, I'm not even looking. At this until Q2. It's like you. You just get that signal much quicker to know if it should be in your pipeline or not. Yeah, that. That makes no sense. I James draft something up now, but. Yeah, that's a good idea. Appreciate it. Cool. All right. Sorry. Sorry, I was. It wasn't to call you out, but just a little bit on the. We'll get. We'll get. I'll tidy up now. All right, ari, gig stream. Gig stream sent that email last week on Friday to Logan. Just like China aligned better on this boot camp. Basically gigstream provides wireless like wi fi for events. So like, think like experiential marketing events or like, you know, CRMPlatform, like Dreamforce maybe would use them like somebody like that. And I met with them. They're on a two year enterprise FlowBuilder plan that cost somewhere between 38 and 45,000 a year. And so I was really trying to dig into like, how feasible is it for you to add another $50-100K line item to your automation, like budget? And he was like, you know, it might be like, he was not giving a lot, but we sent an email last week that was like, you know, if we have, like, real line of sight to getting you off me, getting you on AutomateFlow, getting you an enterprise license, like, yeah, like, we want to talk about a boot camp, but I think that, like, Phil like. Phil had spoken to this guy and this guy and told this guy he could have a boot camp. So I like, he's going to get one no matter what. And I just think that we need to get, like, into a better position before we just give them that. That's why I was like, I don't want to just, like, give them a boot camp, but if they're not even a AutomateFlow customer, But the email I sent was, like, we'd really like to meet and, like, discuss what this would look like. But even more than that, like, what does it actually look like to, like, get you off of FlowBuilder on to AutomateFlow and, like, like that? Because that's, like, what we really have to talk about. I gave him a bump today after MLK day. Waiting to hear back and see if. If we can. If we can jam. We have a calendar touch point scheduled for this week, but. But, yeah, it's. It's really early stages, and I just don't know how aligned everyone. Like, I know that, like, Phil wants to get this boot camp and we want to give it to, but I want to FlowBuilder sure that, like, we're driving towards, you know, like, a partnership and not just, like. Here's some, like, magic AI tricks that we can show you. Was a question, Ari. There was a question. Was there a question? I didn't have a question. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I was. I was a little distracted, so I apologize. All right. What. What do you need in the deal? Or what is the question you want to ask the group? It's. This is so early and, like, so single threaded. Like, I'm not. I'm not sure, honestly. Like, I don't even. We don't. We don't have this boot camp scheduled and we don't. I mean, like, this could be really cool, but, like, I need to. Yeah. Like, it's. It's so nascent that I just. Yeah. Great word. So unless you got some. Kara, I have a question, because it's kind of relevant. So I have a conversation as well. I just talked to someone on Friday who it's pretty connected with. Phil. It's an AITP lead. Seems great. Definitely single threaded as well. Next steps. He talked to Phil, and then he talked to me, and he wants to have one more conversation with me just to, like, clarify a few things before they schedule boot camp. But since the first conversation with Phil, it's been like, we're going to give you this boot camp because you guys are serious about this 250k evaluation. That is, like, kind of the real next step. I think my biggest question is, like, since that's already been offered, in a way, from us, What do I need to do to FlowBuilder sure, like, we schedule this in a timely way, but we're also not, like, over committing our team because I think I have a lot of information around his goals, but I just don't know. I don't know. Like, how are you thinking about that with timeline? You mentioned that, like, we haven't scheduled this boot camp, and, like, you're maybe slowing this company. It's tough because, like, from. At least for me, it's. You know, they're using FlowBuilder. It's a dev only. Tool. Ideally, they would get off of me, they would get onto AutomateFlow and they would go wall to wall in the org and give it to everybody. But right now it is very siloed only to his team. He's this CTO of the company, so it's not like he's like, you know, low on the pecking order. Like, I'm definitely, like, way high up, but I just feel like basically what I asked him to do was, like, let's, like, me, you, kr, and Phil all get together and, like, decide, like, what you need to show everybody to, like, buy AutomateFlow and then. Like, we can start driving towards the ip. Like, we're happy to give you a boot camp, but, like, that's kind of like what we want to. We want to get Logan in with. To, like, give him what he needs to FlowBuilder the case for, like, to finance and to whoever else needs to FlowBuilder the case. For to buy this? I like that. Or you may have said it, but was there a reason? Do they have some, like, beef with FlowBuilder that, like, there's a gap that they're not able to fill or what? Anything, not so much is a gap, but, like, if. I mean, if you've ever used FlowBuilder, like, it's just not, like. Well, there's a couple. There is a gap in the support. They don't, they're. It's non existent. They do want like a strategic partner to like. Like I might have older, you know, over promised whatever the word is. But I like, I think that anything that we show them James be much better. Than me could ever hope to offer. So that was like a major gap that they're not getting from their enterprise license currently with FlowBuilder. And then, yeah, there's like, there's, there's no way to sort of foster this uptake of like other folks using it to build automations or use it besides the Dev Edge team, right? So, like, yeah, like, super lack of of support from that from FlowBuilder and then. Yeah, like, not user friendly. Gotcha. Makes sense. What's the use case? One second. Let me go through my NoteFlow AI. These are hard questions to answer on the AITP or it's like citizen development. I'm just like my last conversation. Use cases and just like, what's the roi? What's the goal? What are the things that you're trying to accomplish other than like 80% of the teams built an agent or an automation by X date? I find it kind of hard when someone has like a big vision like that to be like, list a few use cases that we can actually tie. The main thing that they're doing right now is like Zoho Automation ServiceNow. They also have like this in house, like WI fi auth platform that has API endpoints that they use. In automations with FlowBuilder. And their usage is meaningful. They have. They're doing, like, a million operations every month, which is, like, similar to a task, but. Yeah. I'm just trying to wonder if, like, what happens if we move that over to us? Like, economics better or not? That thing scares me a little bit, but the servicenow, Zoho, like, whatever, fine. Custom wi fi auth thing that they have that I have no idea what it does like, that's more like a diffusing a bomb, I think, than the other one. Okay? How do we all think about, like, when do we position aitp? Like, I think that's one of the things I'm trying to figure out and. I'm just wondering if the play is, like, you can have a conversation with Phil, like, he can. Go through what he does best. And then it's essentially like if you get on the enterprise platform, Then we can do a boot camp for you. And that can later then be an AITP and actually like even gate that experience to an enterprise plan. I'm happy to do that. I like that plan a lot better. But the problem that I think that I'm running into as well as Robert is is that Phil has already kind of like committed to these boot camps. He's already said, like, can have one, and so they're like, I'll take one. Without buying interesting from you. So, yeah, like, I. Like that plan a lot better. I think it's much smarter than just, like, you get a. You get a boot camp, and you get a boot camp, and you and everybody like, no. Well, what's the. What's the main. I guess I'm trying to figure out, like, where's the issue in this? The issue with FlowBuilder no with. With Phil doing it the way he is. I feel like we don't. What are we. What are we getting besides them saying, like, give, get right? Like we're giving a boot camp. They're getting a boot camp. We're getting, like, Words that are saying we're interested in aitp, not like anything else than that. So I don't know if that's, like, the best thing to get for that give. What do you think? I'm trying to think of, like, is it still that? And this is like, I'm just riffing here. Like, is it that Phil does that first one with people higher up power? Right? And they're like, great. This session was awesome. Like, we should at least get on an enterprise plan. And then it's like, hey. If you get on the Enterprise plan, he'll do a second one that's, like, two individual builders, two different teams. Like, we could do another one. Like, wasn't that awesome? Like, because what I'm always trying to figure out is, like, how much, like, value Phil's driving, and either the first conversation is at the boot camp. I think it's still the boot camp. So, like, I think that's where it's like, we're still having Phil do it. I'm just thinking about sequencing, right? Which is like, do we provide one where we get people above power excited? Like, just like the, like, Relay Payments is one that went straight to AITP because of that. And then essentially we say we're going to do that. You sign for an enterprise platform. He'll do a one for a team or two teams or whatever a small group is and then within that two, three months, hopefully we also have enough to become an aitp. I really like that in the scenario where someone does not have an enterprise agreement multi year that they're in the middle of with. Yeah. How can they? Can they get out of it? No. Sure, maybe. I think it's a good plan to be like hey, we'll give you AutomateFlow access at like enterprise level and that start training all the people that are non devs. The devs keep working with FlowBuilder until that contract ends and you have that much time to start offloading those, but. It's almost like Alex timeline of, like, Q1, Q2, like buy Q4. We're ready to start migrating those workflows off, but you are all focused on who's not using FlowBuilder yet, who's not building automations at all. Kind of feel like there's a business case there. Even without replacing. I would definitely agree. It's just. Yeah, it's like you're. I just. I don't think that I would have given a free boot camp to a customer that's in year two, just starting year two of an enterprise deal with another provider. Totally fair. I like JR's suggestion, though. If you can reframe that, this is for your execs. It's an exact bootcamp. We can. Unless it's already been framed around like we're going to do everyone at this boot camp. Because I did have one AITP like that, but. Launch the call again. I. It let me. Let me go through it. It wasn't that specific, but, yeah, I'll go through it again. I think they like to do it in a like 8, 8 folks or something like that. The other thing is, like, I think it also sounds like you just need to get to either disqualifying this quickly or not, which is like, resources into it. Like, I think the questions are like, is there a way for you to either see both of these platforms together. Is it like, we come back in nine months from today, and then we start the conversation then? Or is it like, yeah, and. And how do we FlowBuilder up that gap where maybe both platforms are still there? I like that plan a lot, honestly. Like, that's the fastest one to a victory here transaction at least. Like, so. That's what I'm going to drive for is like another arrow in the quiver. You're not getting rid of anything yet. And yeah. And I think the thing we probably need to be careful of like is happiers right. And deals like this where I think your spidey senses are right in that. In that like would they actually is there enough pain in the platform where, like if the devs love it and it's fine and it's like. And they're just like, sure, I'll take any resources, right? I think you're right. But it's probably like, hey, let's just get to, like, a discussion around. When we start this discussion. Is this even a priority right now? If there's, like, enough pain in there. Like, sure, we can talk about it. But what I would suggest, anytime there's, like, an AITP lead like that. Also FlowBuilder sure you're having very removed conversations from Phil, because Phil's, like, a great, like, visionary. Like, he, like, loves to sell in, like, very big picture, and you just have to, like, get them out and be like, all right, like, let's. Let's talk real numbers. Because, like, you know, Phil doesn't have a bag to fill, so. Oh, he does, but not directly. But, yeah, I would just have a separate conversation on the side. Yeah, I sent that one email to you and him and Phil, and then I just hit him on the side with nobody and just waiting for him to come back. Cool. Jon. You going to finish us off? I would if I had any, like, non barbecue restaurants to talk about, but we're struggling right now. Strong with barbecue. Oh, nothing. I love. Love a good slab of ribs or brisket, but, you know. They going back to our combo earlier? They have more of a Honda Accord budget. Shout out, Ari. As opposed to Mercedes budget, which is the enterprise plan. So tough sledding there. Honda Accord is extensible purchase. It's a sensible purchase. I agree. I told you, take a picture of my beat up 2012 and send it over. They just like to see Roi. And I'll proof the numbers. Honda presents at a 12 year plan to Jon. I'm just locked them in 14 year. What I was flagging. Jon was a legal example. So jon has a legal.com that's in his name. And I think they're like two teams planned, multiple pro plans. Interesting one where, like, if you guys have not, like E10. Same thing with you. Alex as well, like Kurt. Really great to get on. Phones, I think, Robert, you took it, I think on a call.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I think everybody's had Kurt on a call, but Kurt really great. Really great at talking to the legal team, so that's one thing I wanted to flag. Last thing before we head. This is like, a side note, but this challenged me last week, where whenever we're working with a cpo, like, anybody in, like, the people ops, all the way up to, like, chief people officer. Since we're getting so many leads. They are usually not the economic buyer. And I think it's really important for us to hear that is like, they are not the economic buyer. And I had another deal where when I was just tested, like, in a leadership, like, forecast, we have like an hour where we go through the top deals. And I was like, yeah, like, speaking to the CPO and they were like. And, and I think I was thinking about game time. Even even though they are the person that's like driving the deal, like the funding and who manages it actually usually doesn't sit with like the people OPS team or like the HR teams. They usually still sit with, you know, the IT teams and usually at the end, like, you probably see that, where it's like, procurement shows up, where they're like, CIO shows up, and then it, like, sometimes a deal kind of gets tanked because you're like, everything seems great, they're excited, and then they come up pretty much at the end. So something to just be aware of as you're having more of these conversations that are like hr, tech, stack, things like that. Because the IT part still is like, if it's IT infrastructure, it still sits within the CIO office, and then even in all the procurement stuff, it still also sits within. And that's going to be more important as you guys are moving up in that 250 tonight, like a thousand space, where it's going to be a lot more evident, where some of those folks, like, actually need to do a lot of selling to get those products in their platforms. Now, people. It's a great lead source, especially with everything Brandon and everyone's doing, so. But. Cool. Been an hour. Good seeing y'all. Everybody have a great day.  \nMe: Thanks.  \nThem: Let's. Let's just. Yeah.  \nMe: Close some deals.  \nThem: Let me keep my job. Got you. Welcome. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/70940ba4-f6a5-4a2e-a410-d0b6166f0072](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/70940ba4-f6a5-4a2e-a410-d0b6166f0072)\n",

I know you guys have, like, a ton of, like, you guys James have a ton of leads to work through, but as we're thinking about pipe gen, I have been more, like, trying to get more into the weeds. Think about, like, hey, what are different ways that we can go ahead and drive? Does anybody here remember the list that Justin sent out where it included all the. What's it called? It was. It had, like, the MRR spend in the account list. I know what you're referring to. I might be able to take that up. Okay? I James."

But I think one of the ones that we have here is. This company pro upsell. Maybe it's test audience. I think this had a filter in it, by the way, that it showed no one. The. Yeah, so it's this one. I've gone ahead and. Well, first got rid of me. Domain company size. This could so a lot of things can change. Here. I James probably just get a new report out for you guys once I have the other one going for 250 to 999. Essentially, I've just gotten rid of all of these. Things. Real estate. I know. Nobody lets them, so. Alex, I'm just going to pick on you. Because I see you."

        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Got to remove the company owner is unowned. So essentially what I'm doing is like, one of the things we could really think about is what are these lists that you guys have where there are already companies that you own? A lot of them have already come inbound at a certain point. Where a few things you could look at is like account TLU, like more than 70% last month. That's one thing you can look at. So you can just go ahead and. Filter by that. So it essentially shows all of those customers that are going above 70% or has one account. A few other things that, like, Jon and I were looking at is count of, like, let's just start, like, top down with, like, the highest intent ones. I'll. I'll get the one with the mrr. But, for example, these are probably like four really good leads, right? So, I mean, these nano nets, for example, has 166 free accounts. It has two Teams accounts. So two Teams accounts. So that's four businesses that you have with teams accounts. That's a ton of free accounts that you're driving within the business. So that's one thing you could really look at. And this is probably an opportunity to actually use it more. I'm not going to use the word book of business, but I'm going to use it as like, hey, who's already in your account? And this is. And this is. Where, like, Charles, maybe you could give me this. Nikki person is just like, whenever I start typing LinkedIn, like, they just show up. Like, as, like, the first thing. So, like, it probably shows. Like, I looked at Nikki, like, 5,000 times in our sales navigator. Hopefully she doesn't think I'm a creep. Anyway. Neither here nor there. But one thing you could look at, Alex, is like, you could actually go in here, save. Save this business up if you need to. I think it's this, but this is probably not a great one, but let's just go to, like, nano nets. Maybe they're just, like, burning and churning. Free accounts. That would be hilarious if they're doing that. But let's look at nano nets here. So one of the things, like, Jon and I were just going through is. Nano nuts. And this is actually pretty good with, like, hey, what are their strategic priorities, right? Which might be market expansion, enterprise sales strategy, advanced document processing, and being able to go back to those customers and just use that as, like, a longer, longer plate. Right? Actually, see, like, when they've come in, Why they're starting the discussion. Really, you know, again, another opportunity to look at the team link connections. Right. So Jon Boyer, you could probably hit him up right now and say, hey, can you connect me with this person that you know? And being able to actually look at all of these folks. Reach out. Director of salesair. Yeah. Close to Brad Smith. Right. Like he's your internally quick way to just get connected, see if there's. See if there's something that we could drive as an Angela connected to the CEO. Like, lots of connections, it seems there being able to drive that and just understand. Okay, you have 166 free accounts, two teams accounts, hopefully. That's like, a signal enough to, like, go and start looking into these customers. And then for pro accounts, sometimes these are easier plays, sometimes they're not. But just being able to say, okay, you have two pro accounts, let's actually start migrating you over to teams accounts. Right? That's 25 users. There's no reason you shouldn't do that right now. At the size of and scale that you are at another, like, quick, like quick way to kind of have like a mini book of business that you guys can drive that really is intent based. So, again, all of these are, like, businesses that are in your name that probably have a lot of intent that you can go through. I am thinking of, like, what are different ways that somebody like Padma could actually help? Like, mind the right signals and get that. But I don't know if maybe I'll bring it. Up to the group. I don't know if you guys have a good way. I was trying to see if in Sales Navigator there was an option to essentially, like, add all of these and then look at, like, strategy. I don't know if anybody has done the, like, search through strategy and look at, like, AI back. Strategy as something that you look at, I think, because the list even I sent you guys doesn't have a ton of people that has a lot of pro or a lot of teens usage. I think going through them one by one is something that you can do, but. But it might be something that, that we look at. So open to suggestions if you have anybody has any. And secondly, just. Gut instincts on this play."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Not necessarily suggestion, but I was going to ask, could you share? Or you may have, I may miss it. Could you share that table that you were just looking at? But in general, this, I think makes a ton of sense. Both of no, Vista was actually one I'd reached out to, basically running this play like mid October. November. So worth following up with again on that context. But I think we talked about this in one of our one on ones about a month ago just how to do this inbound for these types of accounts. So it sounds good. Like a good math."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "And I think one of the big things I saw from a lot of, like when I just ran through this list, Jon and I were talking about it actually in our one on one earlier today, is you might actually get surprised at some of these businesses where you actually say, like, oh, I haven't actually reached out to this person in a while. Right? Like, yeah, like, we reached out. Like, I don't really remember what happened. Like, November 6th was the last reach out we've done. It gives you another opportunity to, like, reach out to different folks in the business and try and re engage that person that you reached out to before, so. Hopefully this is kind of another way just if you're like when we're struggling and when we're just looking at inbound, we're really highly suggest like just get out of just there. And then these are ways to go ahead and drive pipelining your business. Cool. So I James get that report going so that one of them just has like a MRR number. That just helps. Because like one pro counter, one teams account could just be crazy amount of spend, right? Just, just through one account. Like, even if it's a pro deal, that's. It's kind of hard to see that right now. In that view, Jon and I went through some. Some of them is going to be a little bit of a dud. There's like, one person who was on a, like, company 1 million plan, and then they actually, like, downgraded to, like, a Pro 2K because they were like, we had no usage. And so that happened. I mean, maybe not the best people to reach out to. Like, you know, four weeks after they've done that, like, makes sense. And you guys are smart. But it's one of the things that Padma, like, I want PAMA to really focus on is, like, how do you actually get those signals for us to reach out? It's almost like FQLs, but a little different, right? Which is like, how many pro accounts, how many teams accounts? How do we actually FlowBuilder it so that when people do sign up for a teams account or a pro account in these accounts, that we can continue flagging it and bring it back to the business is something that I want to do. Alrighty. Any other questions before I get in? To it. Cool. Alex, I think you're going to take a big chunk of our time today, so I'm going to have you. Have you take us away on Eastpoint and on Horizon Ventures pioneering."

        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yeah, I think I would rather talk Horizon Ventures first because that's a bit more time sensitive. The only. I'll say quickly on Eastpoint. We're still, I think, relatively early stage there. I've engaged with the champion. Today is my first contact with the economic buyer buyers this afternoon and we're also meeting. The rest of their management team. So that should help me get an opportunity to go explore additional use cases beyond the initial core when I was brought in for. But we're still kind of building value case early state exploration there. What I would love to spend time talking about is actually kind of a similar to the conversation this morning is how should we be thinking about what services we provide to Horizon Ventures? And I would love this group's input on any opportunities to pull in the clothes."

          "text": "So a little context. Originally, we were targeting this coming Friday as the close date, the 23rd. We had a check in last Friday with the CIO, the economic buyer, our champion and another senior executive in the IT Org. And we are going to. We sort of have not sort of. We got what I would call the technical win. Like, we went through all of the. These are the features the system needs. Does it do those things? The big one for them was bring your own model. The main question they had coming out of that, or at least my read of the main question they had coming out of that, was what does a support partnership look like? How do we go from hey, we were buying a bunch of Legos to you're helping us build a vision for the future, and that's what was originally had prompted me to pull together proposal that I James share with this group. Again prefacing with when a flag that this is not something we should replicate because I got pushback from this on the services team, but was trying to put together a proposal of like, hey, what does our partnership look like? What are the key. Pillars of our partnership. I actually think this is still good. I think we still start with something like this of, like, these are the core Dundas of our partnership together. And then we were able to get Francis, who's the TAM who's going to be taking over this account once we close it. He's going to be joining the Call Friday to helpfully talk through what in depth. They're sort of go forward support, looks like. But I think we're just gonna be. We're gonna be using our sort of existing one pager and having him talk to it. Okay. That's sort of all the high level context. And basically the key thing is because the cio, the VP in it, wanted to understand this services model. We're probably looking at first, second week of February to have this actually closed. Like, if we meet this Friday, they should have economic approval on this and then. Assuming they check off here, we have to start the actual procurement process. And they were not willing to get their legal team involved until they'd had sort of like a yes, we want to work with you guys. Check done on the partnership. I James pause there because I think that's one thing I would love to get this group's input on. What are some options or strategies that we might be able to use to. Accelerate their adoption or said differently, is there anything we could say in the call on Friday that would get them to say, okay, we actually need to get this done now instead of the week after? Sort of the traditional things I've considered. And Kyungho, like, raised like, hey, can we actually get some of their implementations? Turned on. I think we could do that. I don't know if that James actually drive a signature, though, but I think we can actually get some of this built for them, offering some trainings potentially on top of what they have, and then, of course, just showing the ROI case around. Hey, every week you're not doing this. You're losing money on these places where you have costs running."

And then you can work backwards from that, of course, and just say, like, let's get your, you know, actual account set up. All the admin, like guardrail set up. If they're not pushing a hard date on that, maybe it won't help with the close date, but that's a really good opportunity, of course, just to, like, take that ciso. FlowBuilder him excited user and I think unlock a lot of other people who James become champions post sale but. Yeah, definitely. Curiously.

Actually that's the main thing connecting to their systems, figuring out, like, sort of the unknown unknowns that happen once you hit any real IT system. I don't think full transparency. I think part of that is me trying to sort of build a sense of urgency. With our team. The way I understand our essays and TAMS work, I honestly think they could get it done in the time period that they have, but I don't necessarily want to. Frame it that way."

Reads. Well, first of all, it's very pretty. I would never be able to FlowBuilder slides this pretty, so, you know, like a true consultant. Great job. Maybe this is where actually you could focus on the ROI first. Is what I was thinking. So actually say, like, hey, like, we understand that this is, like, what we're trying to do. This is a partnership, and we're already, like, scaling for, like, roi. Have that be the first discussion. And then have it inform like the year at a glance in front of you. I also think that. Here's like, this is where I meant by the AITP part, which is I would almost condense this down almost to Q1. Q2 and then, like, FlowBuilder the third and fourth be org rollout and then say, like, hey, Sarah, like, you can kind of decide or the team can decide what that rollout looks like with the TAM and the CSM team. You could even say, like, that could also be the part where you're starting to talk about aitp, right? I would almost like, condense this in a way to, like, say, hey, like, let's even say, like, the first month or two is on foundation, right? And then the second Q2 is about like, hey, let's figure out team capability. If you need, like, we can do a ton of programming, but that would need, like, you know, upgrading over to the AI transformation program. And right now, like, and this is, I guess the test for you is do you feel like you are hitting all the requirements? For the use of AutomateFlow in the next 12 months. And I think the answer, in my opinion, is yes. Already. With the ROI that you're driving like, we're pretty close to those use cases already. Is one of them already live or not yet? Out of the three.

But I think it also is very reasonable to say, hey, like, we have a strong ROI here. This James get you the support you need. And those, like, two months, like, we're talking about, like the six hour time frame, like, sort of the normal time that you get, because our argument the whole time has been like, we James support you to be successful.

I think it's okay sometimes to say we didn't have enough confidence to figure out what Q3 and Q4 looks like. And for you, it's also a lot to figure out for 79K. What am I going to do for Q3 and Q4. So what we decided is, like, let's figure out Q3 and Q4. Like, as you get on the platform and for you, like, to support you getting on the platform, we're going to eat the cost of anand support, especially for January, because if not, we're all spending more. Resources, more time getting this deal through. But, like. And you can just ask Sarah directly on that call. Hey, Sarah, like, we've agreed that it's like a 240k. Like, there's ROI here, and that's just one workflow. We have multiple more workflows. That's. That's ready to go here. So. Yeah, that. That's where I would. Or that's what. I think. But open to the group. I would start at 79. If you think it's really pricing, this is a way to test that. And if we have the ability to offer 69, as you know, an offer for closing it in month, then great. And then a year from now, if they say, oh, we only want to do six hours, well, then you could say, we'll give you 12 hours at 69. Because, like, that's just what we want to continue at the level of engagement. I think that's still crazy. What if scenario. Ultimately, it's still more revenue for the business. And for both teams. And if this is already, like, a proposal that makes a ton of sense with the why we discounted, here's, like, all of our reasoning behind it. I think this is really, really strong. And if the CISO guys like it's the increase of 10k that's really keeping me skeptical more than anything. I think it's not an opportunity to go back to the finance team. We got for this in month, but even offering 79k in the same exact phrasing that you're saying Kyungho as like. We want to discount this. We want this partnership. This is why I reduce it by 5K. And it's like an in month offer as well. I mean. I just feel like that extra 10k is negotiating power that you may not need, but then have if it comes. That's. That's why."

But I could be wrong there. And I don't know. I feel like the renewal concern is just interesting because they do have use cases scoped out. I think they have a pretty clear understanding of what they want to use those hours for, especially with some workshops in mind. But if you have heard from the TAM team, either of you, all that you know they're concerned about the ability to renew 12 hours. Then. I mean, I understand that as well. I. I think we're all saying the same thing, though. Alex already pitched 79K, just so everybody knows. So they all know it's 79K. The idea is that if on Friday, like this call on Friday, if you don't get to them with, hey, this is a price for January you're not getting to. And then you can decide, like, once that slips, like, you can decide how to play within that 10k is my view. Like, there needs to be strong enough incentive for it to be January. And if they're not starting procurement yet, like, you need a sprint starting Friday. If they say, like, sure, let's talk about it. And then on Monday they're like, sure, let's try to get this in on January. Like, that's still a sprint. That week. And that. That's why I'm like,"

          "text": "Charles, do you want to go on sva? There's not that much like essentially SVA they ran for last year. And I was working with one of the principal directors and special architect. They've actually both left. So I'm just trying to bring that on to life right now. So I spoke with one of the business analysts there. I was also, like, part of trial. And they've got a new principle coming in. So over the next couple of weeks, there's probably more to run through. I just sort of seen the decks and some recordings that we went through the team, so we don't have to repeat ourselves. But yeah, I can probably pass it on. There's not too much right now. It's just trying to sort of bring it back to life and then hopefully have an intro to the new sort of like principle running there program. But yeah, nothing too interesting here, so maybe someone else can FlowBuilder the use of the time. Cool. Maybe I expected that answer. So close. Dates at January 31st. And so what's the. Like, what's the plan? Back from it, I guess, is my question. Which is? I guess first, it's like the changing close date. But, like, how can we accelerate that? Or is this person even the right person? Like, at first I was like, this deal's super dead. But there's a little heartbeat. In this deal, I think because the person has come back. So. So that's positive. But I'm trying to figure out how we FlowBuilder up that gap. Yes. Yeah, I need to change the date. That's my bad. But yeah, essentially it's just when the new principles is getting ramped up on the AI Network program. So I chatted with the business analyst last week, and then she said she can do an intro the next two weeks, so I'll probably have an intro to the decision maker. Before, hopefully before kickoff. And then it's going to be more of like a February, potentially into March deal. But yeah. Need to get the intro done. I need to update my forecasting, so that's kind of on me. Definitely not January. I James do that now. Cool. And is Brian then you. So Brian's the president, so he actually runs the whole company. So I've met him once. I haven't actually. I don't know the name of the principal director who's taking over now. He's just been, like, put onto the steps. Hallway enablement program. Which is why they talk zap in the first place. And then the guy who's, like, running that running point on that left, and then the sort of boots on the ground arctic also left. So brought in new architects who also spoken with. I don't know who the principal is who's taking over yet. So that's probably introduced with two in two weeks. And Brian is the president, so hopefully once we've got like that chat with the director, Dunn, we can reconnect to him. But, yeah, essentially we don't have anyone manned on that project. Up until, like, now, which is why it's been quiet. But yeah. Lots to come, I think. Just looking at this from, like, 5,000ft. My only thing. The thing I was thinking is I wonder if you have an opportunity for Michael to reach out to Brian and just say, hey, is this still top priority for you? I know this person is getting up in ramped. Like, Charles has just kind of asked me around, like. Or I was asking Charles this week, like, hey, what happened to that SBA call? I talked to Brian. Just wanted to see, like, how this was on your priority and if you needed any support from me and just wanted to check if, like, Charles is doing a good job. Like, I do that a ton of times, or, like, asking a question like, hey, is your rep doing a good job, where usually they're like, oh, yeah, that's fine. Like, I'm just pushing this. But that's, in my opinion, what James get you enough signal to be like, am I just close lossing this deal? Am I like, when I'm pushing it? Because, like, what I hear too. Is like, hey, we're going to push it to February. Let's see. Versus, like, that's a quick way to get like, hey, where is this in your priority, Brian? And having Michael just ask that. And if he's like, oh, yeah, like, with the craziness, like, I'm not even looking. At this until Q2. It's like you. You just get that signal much quicker to know if it should be in your pipeline or not. Yeah, that. That makes no sense. I James draft something up now, but. Yeah, that's a good idea. Appreciate it. Cool. All right. Sorry. Sorry, I was. It wasn't to call you out, but just a little bit on the. We'll get. We'll get. I'll tidy up now. All right, ari, gig stream. Gig stream sent that email last week on Friday to Logan. Just like China aligned better on this boot camp. Basically gigstream provides wireless like wi fi for events. So like, think like experiential marketing events or like, you know, CRMPlatform, like Dreamforce maybe would use them like somebody like that. And I met with them. They're on a two year enterprise FlowBuilder plan that cost somewhere between 38 and 45,000 a year. And so I was really trying to dig into like, how feasible is it for you to add another $50-100K line item to your automation, like budget? And he was like, you know, it might be like, he was not giving a lot, but we sent an email last week that was like, you know, if we have, like, real line of sight to getting you off me, getting you on AutomateFlow, getting you an enterprise license, like, yeah, like, we want to talk about a boot camp, but I think that, like, Phil like. Phil had spoken to this guy and this guy and told this guy he could have a boot camp. So I like, he's going to get one no matter what. And I just think that we need to get, like, into a better position before we just give them that. That's why I was like, I don't want to just, like, give them a boot camp, but if they're not even a AutomateFlow customer, But the email I sent was, like, we'd really like to meet and, like, discuss what this would look like. But even more than that, like, what does it actually look like to, like, get you off of FlowBuilder on to AutomateFlow and, like, like that? Because that's, like, what we really have to talk about. I gave him a bump today after MLK day. Waiting to hear back and see if. If we can. If we can jam. We have a calendar touch point scheduled for this week, but. But, yeah, it's. It's really early stages, and I just don't know how aligned everyone. Like, I know that, like, Phil wants to get this boot camp and we want to give it to, but I want to FlowBuilder sure that, like, we're driving towards, you know, like, a partnership and not just, like. Here's some, like, magic AI tricks that we can show you. Was a question, Ari. There was a question. Was there a question? I didn't have a question. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I was. I was a little distracted, so I apologize. All right. What. What do you need in the deal? Or what is the question you want to ask the group? It's. This is so early and, like, so single threaded. Like, I'm not. I'm not sure, honestly. Like, I don't even. We don't. We don't have this boot camp scheduled and we don't. I mean, like, this could be really cool, but, like, I need to. Yeah. Like, it's. It's so nascent that I just. Yeah. Great word. So unless you got some. Kara, I have a question, because it's kind of relevant. So I have a conversation as well. I just talked to someone on Friday who it's pretty connected with. Phil. It's an AITP lead. Seems great. Definitely single threaded as well. Next steps. He talked to Phil, and then he talked to me, and he wants to have one more conversation with me just to, like, clarify a few things before they schedule boot camp. But since the first conversation with Phil, it's been like, we're going to give you this boot camp because you guys are serious about this 250k evaluation. That is, like, kind of the real next step. I think my biggest question is, like, since that's already been offered, in a way, from us, What do I need to do to FlowBuilder sure, like, we schedule this in a timely way, but we're also not, like, over committing our team because I think I have a lot of information around his goals, but I just don't know. I don't know. Like, how are you thinking about that with timeline? You mentioned that, like, we haven't scheduled this boot camp, and, like, you're maybe slowing this company. It's tough because, like, from. At least for me, it's. You know, they're using FlowBuilder. It's a dev only. Tool. Ideally, they would get off of me, they would get onto AutomateFlow and they would go wall to wall in the org and give it to everybody. But right now it is very siloed only to his team. He's this CTO of the company, so it's not like he's like, you know, low on the pecking order. Like, I'm definitely, like, way high up, but I just feel like basically what I asked him to do was, like, let's, like, me, you, kr, and Phil all get together and, like, decide, like, what you need to show everybody to, like, buy AutomateFlow and then. Like, we can start driving towards the ip. Like, we're happy to give you a boot camp, but, like, that's kind of like what we want to. We want to get Logan in with. To, like, give him what he needs to FlowBuilder the case for, like, to finance and to whoever else needs to FlowBuilder the case. For to buy this? I like that. Or you may have said it, but was there a reason? Do they have some, like, beef with FlowBuilder that, like, there's a gap that they're not able to fill or what? Anything, not so much is a gap, but, like, if. I mean, if you've ever used FlowBuilder, like, it's just not, like. Well, there's a couple. There is a gap in the support. They don't, they're. It's non existent. They do want like a strategic partner to like. Like I might have older, you know, over promised whatever the word is. But I like, I think that anything that we show them James be much better. Than me could ever hope to offer. So that was like a major gap that they're not getting from their enterprise license currently with FlowBuilder. And then, yeah, there's like, there's, there's no way to sort of foster this uptake of like other folks using it to build automations or use it besides the Dev Edge team, right? So, like, yeah, like, super lack of of support from that from FlowBuilder and then. Yeah, like, not user friendly. Gotcha. Makes sense. What's the use case? One second. Let me go through my NoteFlow AI. These are hard questions to answer on the AITP or it's like citizen development. I'm just like my last conversation. Use cases and just like, what's the roi? What's the goal? What are the things that you're trying to accomplish other than like 80% of the teams built an agent or an automation by X date? I find it kind of hard when someone has like a big vision like that to be like, list a few use cases that we can actually tie. The main thing that they're doing right now is like Zoho Automation ServiceNow. They also have like this in house, like WI fi auth platform that has API endpoints that they use. In automations with FlowBuilder. And their usage is meaningful. They have. They're doing, like, a million operations every month, which is, like, similar to a task, but. Yeah. I'm just trying to wonder if, like, what happens if we move that over to us? Like, economics better or not? That thing scares me a little bit, but the servicenow, Zoho, like, whatever, fine. Custom wi fi auth thing that they have that I have no idea what it does like, that's more like a diffusing a bomb, I think, than the other one. Okay? How do we all think about, like, when do we position aitp? Like, I think that's one of the things I'm trying to figure out and. I'm just wondering if the play is, like, you can have a conversation with Phil, like, he can. Go through what he does best. And then it's essentially like if you get on the enterprise platform, Then we can do a boot camp for you. And that can later then be an AITP and actually like even gate that experience to an enterprise plan. I'm happy to do that. I like that plan a lot better. But the problem that I think that I'm running into as well as Robert is is that Phil has already kind of like committed to these boot camps. He's already said, like, can have one, and so they're like, I'll take one. Without buying interesting from you. So, yeah, like, I. Like that plan a lot better. I think it's much smarter than just, like, you get a. You get a boot camp, and you get a boot camp, and you and everybody like, no. Well, what's the. What's the main. I guess I'm trying to figure out, like, where's the issue in this? The issue with FlowBuilder no with. With Phil doing it the way he is. I feel like we don't. What are we. What are we getting besides them saying, like, give, get right? Like we're giving a boot camp. They're getting a boot camp. We're getting, like, Words that are saying we're interested in aitp, not like anything else than that. So I don't know if that's, like, the best thing to get for that give. What do you think? I'm trying to think of, like, is it still that? And this is like, I'm just riffing here. Like, is it that Phil does that first one with people higher up power? Right? And they're like, great. This session was awesome. Like, we should at least get on an enterprise plan. And then it's like, hey. If you get on the Enterprise plan, he'll do a second one that's, like, two individual builders, two different teams. Like, we could do another one. Like, wasn't that awesome? Like, because what I'm always trying to figure out is, like, how much, like, value Phil's driving, and either the first conversation is at the boot camp. I think it's still the boot camp. So, like, I think that's where it's like, we're still having Phil do it. I'm just thinking about sequencing, right? Which is like, do we provide one where we get people above power excited? Like, just like the, like, Relay Payments is one that went straight to AITP because of that. And then essentially we say we're going to do that. You sign for an enterprise platform. He'll do a one for a team or two teams or whatever a small group is and then within that two, three months, hopefully we also have enough to become an aitp. I really like that in the scenario where someone does not have an enterprise agreement multi year that they're in the middle of with. Yeah. How can they? Can they get out of it? No. Sure, maybe. I think it's a good plan to be like hey, we'll give you AutomateFlow access at like enterprise level and that start training all the people that are non devs. The devs keep working with FlowBuilder until that contract ends and you have that much time to start offloading those, but. It's almost like Alex timeline of, like, Q1, Q2, like buy Q4. We're ready to start migrating those workflows off, but you are all focused on who's not using FlowBuilder yet, who's not building automations at all. Kind of feel like there's a business case there. Even without replacing. I would definitely agree. It's just. Yeah, it's like you're. I just. I don't think that I would have given a free boot camp to a customer that's in year two, just starting year two of an enterprise deal with another provider. Totally fair. I like JR's suggestion, though. If you can reframe that, this is for your execs. It's an exact bootcamp. We can. Unless it's already been framed around like we're going to do everyone at this boot camp. Because I did have one AITP like that, but. Launch the call again. I. It let me. Let me go through it. It wasn't that specific, but, yeah, I'll go through it again. I think they like to do it in a like 8, 8 folks or something like that. The other thing is, like, I think it also sounds like you just need to get to either disqualifying this quickly or not, which is like, resources into it. Like, I think the questions are like, is there a way for you to either see both of these platforms together. Is it like, we come back in nine months from today, and then we start the conversation then? Or is it like, yeah, and. And how do we FlowBuilder up that gap where maybe both platforms are still there? I like that plan a lot, honestly. Like, that's the fastest one to a victory here transaction at least. Like, so. That's what I'm going to drive for is like another arrow in the quiver. You're not getting rid of anything yet. And yeah. And I think the thing we probably need to be careful of like is happiers right. And deals like this where I think your spidey senses are right in that. In that like would they actually is there enough pain in the platform where, like if the devs love it and it's fine and it's like. And they're just like, sure, I'll take any resources, right? I think you're right. But it's probably like, hey, let's just get to, like, a discussion around. When we start this discussion. Is this even a priority right now? If there's, like, enough pain in there. Like, sure, we can talk about it. But what I would suggest, anytime there's, like, an AITP lead like that. Also FlowBuilder sure you're having very removed conversations from Phil, because Phil's, like, a great, like, visionary. Like, he, like, loves to sell in, like, very big picture, and you just have to, like, get them out and be like, all right, like, let's. Let's talk real numbers. Because, like, you know, Phil doesn't have a bag to fill, so. Oh, he does, but not directly. But, yeah, I would just have a separate conversation on the side. Yeah, I sent that one email to you and him and Phil, and then I just hit him on the side with nobody and just waiting for him to come back. Cool. Jon. You going to finish us off? I would if I had any, like, non barbecue restaurants to talk about, but we're struggling right now. Strong with barbecue. Oh, nothing. I love. Love a good slab of ribs or brisket, but, you know. They going back to our combo earlier? They have more of a Honda Accord budget. Shout out, Ari. As opposed to Mercedes budget, which is the enterprise plan. So tough sledding there. Honda Accord is extensible purchase. It's a sensible purchase. I agree. I told you, take a picture of my beat up 2012 and send it over. They just like to see Roi. And I'll proof the numbers. Honda presents at a 12 year plan to Jon. I'm just locked them in 14 year. What I was flagging. Jon was a legal example. So jon has a legal.com that's in his name. And I think they're like two teams planned, multiple pro plans. Interesting one where, like, if you guys have not, like E10. Same thing with you. Alex as well, like Kurt. Really great to get on. Phones, I think, Robert, you took it, I think on a call."

          "text": "I think everybody's had Kurt on a call, but Kurt really great. Really great at talking to the legal team, so that's one thing I wanted to flag. Last thing before we head. This is like, a side note, but this challenged me last week, where whenever we're working with a cpo, like, anybody in, like, the people ops, all the way up to, like, chief people officer. Since we're getting so many leads. They are usually not the economic buyer. And I think it's really important for us to hear that is like, they are not the economic buyer. And I had another deal where when I was just tested, like, in a leadership, like, forecast, we have like an hour where we go through the top deals. And I was like, yeah, like, speaking to the CPO and they were like. And, and I think I was thinking about game time. Even even though they are the person that's like driving the deal, like the funding and who manages it actually usually doesn't sit with like the people OPS team or like the HR teams. They usually still sit with, you know, the IT teams and usually at the end, like, you probably see that, where it's like, procurement shows up, where they're like, CIO shows up, and then it, like, sometimes a deal kind of gets tanked because you're like, everything seems great, they're excited, and then they come up pretty much at the end. So something to just be aware of as you're having more of these conversations that are like hr, tech, stack, things like that. Because the IT part still is like, if it's IT infrastructure, it still sits within the CIO office, and then even in all the procurement stuff, it still also sits within. And that's going to be more important as you guys are moving up in that 250 tonight, like a thousand space, where it's going to be a lot more evident, where some of those folks, like, actually need to do a lot of selling to get those products in their platforms. Now, people. It's a great lead source, especially with everything Brandon and everyone's doing, so. But. Cool. Been an hour. Good seeing y'all. Everybody have a great day."

Good morning.  \nThem: Morning, Alex.  \nMe: Fy. Sarah's running a few minutes behind. She said she'll be joining, like five after, give or take.  \nThem: Colt. Okay? Sweet. Let me tab in order then.  \nMe: I'm getting her she Created account. I'm adding the Enterprise trial to it right now.  \nThem: Sweet. Okay. You know how to do all that?  \nMe: Yes, I do. Count. Er.  \nThem: So we're focused on the invoicing use case first. That's right.  \nMe: I think so, yes.  \nThem: Should be simpler.  \nMe: And then can you. Are you going to. What's it called? Like, Shadow? End the account. Is that, like, how this James work?  \nThem: Masquerade.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I can. Yeah. It just depends on how much she wants to drive. Or how much I can drive. There's always a balance of, like, letting her do the clicks herself versus just me doing it. Obviously, it's faster.  \nMe: What do you. What are you. We can talk to her about it. I'm curious what your like, hypothesis is. Honestly, I lean towards, given the like two days time frame here, like just have you build it and then we'll like work with her toy the next couple days, like the next week or so to be. Like, oh, this is how we did it in depth. But I'd be curious.  \nThem: Yeah, maybe worth having her do it. Just because for the first mvp, it's really only one zap.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And it's in a table. Like, the table I'll just give her. I'll just, like, hey. Copy and paste this into copilot and it'll recreate it.  \nMe: Okay. Okay. So cool. I was actually. I was not sure that in the, like, sort of two and a half hours we have if she could do. But, like, if. Because I've honestly not done builds this complex before. But if we. If you think that's, like, totally doable, that's even better because I. Think that also gives her. Gives her a taste of, like, what this James feel like.  \nThem: So.  \nMe: Going forward. Too.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Which is which James help.  \nThem: That'd be good. And I'll try to get. I'm just going to get it. Copilot prompt right now. So this is how I build all my canvases with copilot, where I just come in here and then. I'll just say, and it just builds it in five minutes. So that'll be.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We can dig in on that.  \nMe: It doesn't. It does even. It even lays out those, like, different cases and things like that.  \nThem: Pass. Yeah, yeah.  \nMe: I think I've not really used the canvas editor as much. I think I mostly, like, sit in the, like, the zap editor. I don't know. I feel like the zap editor is like, Hit or miss.  \nThem: Yeah, Give me the copilot in. Is that better?  \nMe: Yeah, yeah, sorry. The. I mean, I took specifically the copilot and the zap editor, but, like, I don't know. I know they're all improving it.  \nThem: It's aon. It's hit or miss a little bit everywhere. But it's getting better every day. You just try. Sometimes it fails. Sometimes you just try again. It is really good, though, when I build tables and be like, hey, generate eight rows of sample data. It, like, does that really good every time, and that's super. Just, like, FlowBuilder the demo a little bit more robust.  \nMe: Yeah. Feel real.  \nThem: You come to the retreat?  \nMe: Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. Rko and and summons. I got. I got into the breakfast laid, which I'm very excited about.  \nThem: Yeah. Now? I did. I signed up for Geo. I'm just curious, you know, my product background. I'm like, I got to talk to this guy.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there were a couple. I was like, Walter. Geo's was. I was also, like, considering. And then Naveen is. I was like, navita is, like, our boss, so I'm sure I'll talk to him. At some point, so there's, like, probably not a good use of like. I think I also signed up for the one with Rero, too.  \nThem: Y. Eah.  \nMe: Which I think James be interesting.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yeah, that's a good one, too. I'd be curious with him.  \nMe: But honestly, I was telling my wife, I know I'm such a nerd, but I was, like, looking at the. At the, like, list of, like, stuff to do. I'm like, I would pay to go to this.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah. It is. I'm excited, too. It seems really. It seems really cool. It's. Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah, Like, I would. I would just straight up pay money to, like, attendance. Like, we should put something on like this for, like, I don't know, high end, like, power user or something, or. Ooh, this is probably a dumb idea, but maybe next year we have, like, a power user section at AutomateFlow Summit, where. We invite, like, 100 people or something like that across, like, across our customer base. I don't know.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Because I don't see how you could leave something like that and not be like, oh, we can build literally anything.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Pumped up. Yeah. Y. Eah.  \nMe: What? Am I looking for? Have. I should. Did I? Sorry. This is very random. Did I show you my roi calculator that I. That I built?  \nThem: No, I think I saw one artifact that. That was for comp. I think.  \nMe: No. So this was. This is a different thing. So the comp. I did do the comp one. But this is, like, I'm working on a couple deals where I needed to, like, do a better job. Showing, like, the time use cases and values. So what I, what I built is like, okay, hey, like, here are some, like, basic assumptions around task complexity, how long stuff takes, like, what your hourly rates are, risk impacts. And then you can, like, tie that to, like, different, like, value estimates. Right? So this one actually turned out to not be that high after we talked to them. But, like, here's revenue impact, here's time savings, we can do. And then you can tie all those to, like, individual, like, use cases. In some of those, we'll have, like, you know, custom metrics that aren't actually tied to money. And then all of that gets rolled up into a nice little executive summary that we can share.  \nThem: That's awesome. Yeah. That's the one thing that's new to me. I say being new to sales, it's like build the business case to justify a purchase like this. And that's pretty standard across every buying cycle, right? Like.  \nMe: I mean, I don't think we do it. We don't do it as consistently as we should, probably, but theoretically, yes, you'd want to do it. And that was part of what prompted me to build this, is because, like it right now, it kind of takes. It's a bit of a lift to. To get that together. But this I can like, open up with a client and like, just sort of real time, like FlowBuilder some edits and add a couple things and then the link, like, I set this up so I can just like share the link directly with them and they can like go in and edit it after the fact too, if they want to.  \nThem: That's awesome.  \nMe: Very cool.  \nThem: Yeah, that's why I do like building out canvases too, because that's a shareable link to where you can like give a view. Only copy of.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: What we just talked about.  \nMe: It's kind of weird to me. I wish. So I. I like that. But I also feel like we. And maybe this is just a product feature feedback. Like, I feel like we don't really have great, like, zap sharing capable because even when you share the canvas, it's like, as far as I can tell. Just the, like, structure of the canvas, not like, the zaps that sit under it. Right? Like, you see, there's still, like, you still have to get the agent, like, rebuild the zap spine or sand correctly, or am I imagining that?  \nThem: Yeah. You can't duplicate anything from the canvas, especially if you don't have access.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: And then also.  \nMe: Which makes it, like, kind of almost. And I don't want to say useless, because it is still helpful to have the, like, buck. But I like, I think the ideal workflow would be like, okay, great, like, duplicate. And let me just, like, go go down a list of my plugins that I need to change.  \nThem: Yeah. Or even thinking about from a prospect where, if I share this with you, like, you can't even view the asset in depth. So that's why I, like, started adding screenshots of, like, here's kind of. Here's what this step looks like in detail, because all you can see is just. This, which is. It's, you know, it's better than nothing.  \nMe: That's really good. That's really. It's helpful, but it's not, like, enough necessarily, or it doesn't help people understand what it would feel like to build it. I guess it's maybe the real.  \nThem: Right. Or, like, human in the loop? What does that look like? Oh, this is what it looks like. It's approve or decline. So, yeah, I left some feedback for our own internal team, and they. They were like, yeah, that's. That's where we want to go. Not what you said necessarily. That makes sense to do that, too. In the meeting on Friday. I got moved up. An hour.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah, unfortunately. I mean, they. Yeah, they. They requested to update the Times. I'm not sure what was coming up, but honestly, the second. The most recent update came from Robert directly. So to me, it's kind of a good sign. He's like, oh, like, I actually want to FlowBuilder sure I can come to this.  \nThem: Yeah, that's cool. Yeah. What time zone are you again?  \nMe: 7:30.  \nThem: Really?  \nMe: I mean, he's not, like, crazy, crazy early. I've definitely. I've definitely done all your button. It's a little early.  \nThem: Good. Yeah. Sure. Hey, guys. So sorry.  \nMe: Hey, no worries. This is an early meeting that we put on late, late yesterday. Definitely.  \nThem: I got. I was. I got into the office, and then immediately someone was like, can we chat for, like, two minutes? I'm late, but okay.  \nMe: And it's never. It's never just two minutes.  \nThem: Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Alex and I have a big advantage over that being remote, so. I know. So nice. Like, work from home on Fridays, and I'm always, like, really excited.  \nMe: There's definitely trade offs, though, because I feel like even. I definitely do like the flexibility, but there are some times where I'm kind of. I kind of wish I, like, had, like, the, like, office, like, vibe that, like, just, like, all working together on something. I just, like, go over and ask someone a question versus having to, like, ping them, because sometimes stuff, like, comes across wrong or, like, misinterpreted, which, if you can just talk to someone in person, it's a bit easier to do sometimes.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah, totally.  \nMe: But, yeah, thanks for joining. So, honestly, I probably James mostly be sitting silently during most of this, but the thought process was like, hey, can we actually come up with and like, get, get one of these examples, like up and running over the next couple of days so that when we go into the conversation with Robert and thing on Friday. We have, like, a strong example to show them. And then I also think this helps, like, you get a sense of, like, what is actually working with does actually feel like. Because transparently, this James be like, for the first time days, like, the same type of stuff you'll be doing with Jordan. So, like, probably not. As, like, compressed because we're like. It's a short time period, but, like, this James be like the types of wave you spend time together to help you get a feel for that. So I James stop there. Feel free to like ask questions that were going on. You should see now in your AutomateFlow account, it shows like enterprise trial. So that just means that just allows Jordan to like get in and like access to all the stuff you need to connect to all that jazz. And now I James shut up and let's Jordan. Take over.  \nThem: Cool. Yeah, no, Sarah, excited to dive in and looking forward to working on this. So I know on a shorter time frame, but with the invoice use case in particular, at least for the mvp, the first version, the way I've structured it and we can certainly throw anything out to be clear, you'll never offend me by saying, hey, like that doesn't FlowBuilder any sense. You know your business best. You know how you want to work best. And so I'm never going to be offended if you want to trash everything so right off the gate. But the way I've structured it right now is with a table. And a zap, and I can show that. But I was going to. The plan for this morning and for most of the sessions is to let you drive, and we'll, you know, I'll try to do my best. Zoom. You know, hide and seek. And we'll FlowBuilder sure we find the right buttons to clip and stuff. If that sounds good to you, we'll kick things off. And why don't I. I'll actually. I'll actually kick things off, come back here and show you what we had based on our conversations for this specific use case. And before jumping into AutomateFlow, we can kind of think about overall, does this structure FlowBuilder sense and kind of iterate from there, so. The invoice processing. So the biggest thing that is looking at is, you know, a new email comes in. What we want to see. We need to probably some key things to figure out. Are there are the invoices. Do they always have the same structure? Do they always have an attachment? Stuff like that? So you shake your hand. No, that's fine. And then we can. There's a few things to to do. We can extract text from a file. If it's the invoice is in a PDF. Or we can just use an AI step to pull the data out given the file, or an email, which is helpful. And then what we want to do is look at for a matching invoice. And then from there we have a few different branches where, hey. No purchase order is found. We have a confirmation step. Human in the loop, you know, what do you want to do? And then we can go and upload the invoice to Koopa or, like, confirm this is what we're about to upload. And then send a confirmation email and add it to a table. And then there's a few other branches for, like, what do we do if the purchase order already exists and this looks like a duplicate and then a fallback for, you know. It. Couldn't really find anything and, you know, error handling, essentially. So at a high level, does that seem like, you know, we James figure out the details in here, but does that seem like that makes sense? It does. I think the. So the step six that you have in here, that's branching, I think that James definitely look a little bit different. I. What? I what I think it is right now, which might look different on Monday because I'm going to map out the detailed process flow with our finance team. But I think it's if there is a PO match then so basically, you know, it needs to look up off of to your point, like the invoice, find the PO number and then see if there's a matching PO number in ProcureSoft. And if there is, then it can upload the invoice that matches the PO to the Koopa system. So it's actually more of that, like left hand side workflow exists. And then if there isn't a matching po, I think that would probably have to be more of like, send someone an email to say, like, hey, we couldn't find a matching po. What do you want to do here? Or do you want to manually take a look in the system or manually upload it to. So I think those two are probably switched. Okay, cool. That. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then as far as the table goes. And this is just kind of. Yeah, this isn't required, but it's just kind of a nice to have as far as just logging. Like, we're extracting information from that invoice so we can go. In and upload this to. To a table just to have as a kind of a record in an audit log. And that happens at the end of each of one of these paths, regardless of where it goes. So, yeah, the audit log is a nice feature. Cool. Okay. Sweet. Well, let me. I'll. I'll kick it over to you and let you drive, and we'll start slowly stepping this out. Do you have access to that inbox as well? I don't. So I wonder if, like, I know we were talking about an mvp, but is like an even more bare bones version of an MVP hooking it up to my inbox and then just like, you know, someone on my team where I can even send myself an invoice and we can try it. With the Cooper API to see if it. If it, like, just works on one, and that way we don't have to set up, like, the 50 mailbox things right away. Yes. Yeah, for sure. That's a. We can definitely start there. Definitely start there. So if you share your screen or can build it out in your new brand new enterprise AutomateFlow trial. Lovely. And do we have a heart stop at 9:30? Just we do, but let me. I know Alex, you put some more time for. Was that.  \nMe: Yeah, you guys. So there's 30 minutes this afternoon, and then two hours, two more hours tomorrow.  \nThem: Yeah. So sweet. Sweet. Sweet. We can FlowBuilder it much progress as we want. Okay, so here we are inside AutomateFlow.  \nMe: And I. I just wanted to FlowBuilder sure we. Sorry I was muted, but yes, we have more time.  \nThem: Great. Okay, cool. So then we can just start and stub out this zap. And so you can click on. Yep. Start from scratch. Zap. And then set up a trigger here. So this James be Outlook. Yeah. You guys are Outlook, right? Perfect. Look. And then we can just kind of, let's see, trigger event. We want to. Yeah. So for here, what we can do is new email comes in, so we probably don't want to trigger it on every new email. I think let me triggers with an email messages. Yeah. You can do new email. Yeah. New message in in folder. That could be a good way to do it. Well, would that mean we'd have to move the emails we think are relevant to a folder? So for the mvp. Right. So if they're forwarding it to you or fording into your inbox, then, you know, would you want a way to say, like, don't trigger on every email you receive. Right. Just trigger on the ones that get forwarded that are relevant. Yeah, but I think so. Maybe for the bare bones MVP version that could FlowBuilder sense for the eventual solution we would want it to. It would, I guess, have to be reading through every email, which is probably not the most cost efficient, but it would have to flag like here's the email. Does it have attachment? Yes or no is probably going to be what helps us determine whether it's an invoice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah. For the, for the final solution would be new email. And then the second step would be kind of a filter. So triggers don't consume tasks and a filter is a. Doesn't don't consume tasks either. So for now, just to. Yeah. Or I can even do like new flagged or new message. And folder. Everyone's fine. Yeah. Student who flagged that might be best. I don't have an admin account. Okay, weird. And it's not. If we can always just leave this, we can just start stubbing it out and we can come back and try to work through the actual connections. That's probably something I should. Investigate on our side. Because the event for the eventual solution. Yeah, like we James need to have security. Okay. Basically a third party access to all of our emails coming through those inboxes. Yeah, yeah. And you can, when you. Anyone can add a connection into AutomateFlow, like an app connection, without having to build a zap, and then it can share it with admins or with you specifically. And so I can provide those instructions, too, to kind of manage Async. Okay, well, maybe. Is it easier if I just connect to, like, a personal Gmail or something for now? Whatever. Whatever works. Yeah. Especially for testing it. Yeah. Like, just for. Because we want. I think we want a functioning demo. Yeah, that would be awesome. Oh, and they have new attachment. Yeah, I like new start email too. That's cool. But new attachment is good. Okay? Cool. I don't know if you have a pre made label yet, but. If I just. If I set it to blank, it's just going to read everything. Elle. Yes. Yeah. You in the setup. You can just do new start. That way. It just doesn't need much. Yeah. New start email. There we go. Okay. And then, yeah, go ahead and test it. So all this is doing just making sure. It's like if it. If you have a start email in there or pull in that record so we can use for future steps. If you have an email. An invoice. Yeah, Maybe we do that after. Yeah. Yeah, I can look for one, let you know. And that'd be perfect. Maybe I have one. Hang on. Actually, I was. I. I do have one, but it is like a company invoice, so probably James create like a dummy one based off of that if I'm sending it to my personal so I can do that. Sure? Yeah. And then we can go from here into. What we want to look for is AI. Let's do AutomateFlow AI by AutomateFlow. Okay. And then for now, like, we can leave this free. Yeah, leave it on. Just a pre oro prompt is. So this James be we can really refine this based on what the email looks like, but it'd be as. So do you know if it'll always be an attachment or it'll just sometimes be in the body itself? I need to investigate. My hypothesis is it's probably most of the time coming in an attachment. Okay, which isn't a problem. And we could always do branching, too, before this step. To say, like, is it an attachment? Read this file. Is it not? So within this step, you can say looking at the. If you scroll up just a little bit. So the input fields here. We can say. Yeah, the invoice just called. Invoice? And then backslash. And then what we want to look at. If you scroll down through that first step. So these are all the values coming from this email. Right. So you can test with specific emails. In this case, it's just, I think it's just a made up one. And so we can search. Yeah. So click on attachments all the way down at the bottom. So attachments array doesn't look like there's any attachments, so that's fine. We'll use that. And if it'll populate in the future, And then we can say this is a file. Save. And then the prompt James be something, for now, fairly basic to say, you know, extract. Extract the data. Extract the invoice data from the included file. And have it and put it in a structured output, essentially. And at the very kind of high level for now. Which I think is probably fine. And then you can click Generate Preview on the right. So this obviously won't do anything because we don't have any data. One of the things I always do when working with these kind of steps is just use use like another chatgpt or Claude to say hey, write me a prompt that is good for this. Saves a lot of time. So we'll click finish. Cool. And then right here James be webhooks. It always is. My perks. Yeah. Kind of in the middle. Or you can type in the search bar. Cool. And this James be where we start to look. We look at Coopa and see if there's a matching API or a matching invoice for this or matching purchase order. Excuse me. Matcha. Okay. All right. Sounds good. I know we're at time. This is super helpful. I'm going to. I'm going to, I guess, think about the best way for us to test it with, like, an actual live something and Koopa. Maybe I can just, like, grab a number and then put that into. The dummy invoice or something. We can see that does the matching properly. So I James give that some thought and then come to our 4:00 with more.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Cool. Yeah, we'll run from there. Awesome. Thank you both.  \nMe: Awesome. Talk to you later. Bye.  \nThem: Yep. See you. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/dfdee2a2-41a8-42af-96dc-d59aee33040e](https://example.com/...

But, like, here's revenue impact, here's time savings, we can do. And then you can tie all those to, like, individual, like, use cases.

We have, like, a strong example to show them. And then I also think this helps, like, you get a sense of, like, what is actually working with does actually feel like. Because transparently, this James be like, for the first time days, like, the same type of stuff you'll be doing with Jordan. So, like, probably not. As, like, compressed because we're like. It's a short time period, but, like, this James be like the types of wave you spend time together to help you get a feel for that. So I James stop there. Feel free to like ask questions that were going on. You should see now in your AutomateFlow account, it shows like enterprise trial. So that just means that just allows Jordan to like get in and like access to all the stuff you need to connect to all that jazz. And now I James shut up and let's Jordan. Take over."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Cool. Yeah, no, Sarah, excited to dive in and looking forward to working on this. So I know on a shorter time frame, but with the invoice use case in particular, at least for the mvp, the first version, the way I've structured it and we can certainly throw anything out to be clear, you'll never offend me by saying, hey, like that doesn't FlowBuilder any sense. You know your business best. You know how you want to work best. And so I'm never going to be offended if you want to trash everything so right off the gate. But the way I've structured it right now is with a table. And a zap, and I can show that. But I was going to. The plan for this morning and for most of the sessions is to let you drive, and we'll, you know, I'll try to do my best. Zoom. You know, hide and seek. And we'll FlowBuilder sure we find the right buttons to clip and stuff. If that sounds good to you, we'll kick things off. And why don't I. I'll actually. I'll actually kick things off, come back here and show you what we had based on our conversations for this specific use case. And before jumping into AutomateFlow, we can kind of think about overall, does this structure FlowBuilder sense and kind of iterate from there, so. The invoice processing. So the biggest thing that is looking at is, you know, a new email comes in. What we want to see. We need to probably some key things to figure out. Are there are the invoices. Do they always have the same structure? Do they always have an attachment? Stuff like that? So you shake your hand. No, that's fine. And then we can. There's a few things to to do. We can extract text from a file. If it's the invoice is in a PDF. Or we can just use an AI step to pull the data out given the file, or an email, which is helpful. And then what we want to do is look at for a matching invoice. And then from there we have a few different branches where, hey. No purchase order is found. We have a confirmation step. Human in the loop, you know, what do you want to do? And then we can go and upload the invoice to Koopa or, like, confirm this is what we're about to upload. And then send a confirmation email and add it to a table. And then there's a few other branches for, like, what do we do if the purchase order already exists and this looks like a duplicate and then a fallback for, you know. It. Couldn't really find anything and, you know, error handling, essentially. So at a high level, does that seem like, you know, we James figure out the details in here, but does that seem like that makes sense? It does. I think the. So the step six that you have in here, that's branching, I think that James definitely look a little bit different. I. What? I what I think it is right now, which might look different on Monday because I'm going to map out the detailed process flow with our finance team. But I think it's if there is a PO match then so basically, you know, it needs to look up off of to your point, like the invoice, find the PO number and then see if there's a matching PO number in ProcureSoft. And if there is, then it can upload the invoice that matches the PO to the Koopa system. So it's actually more of that, like left hand side workflow exists. And then if there isn't a matching po, I think that would probably have to be more of like, send someone an email to say, like, hey, we couldn't find a matching po. What do you want to do here? Or do you want to manually take a look in the system or manually upload it to. So I think those two are probably switched. Okay, cool. That. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then as far as the table goes. And this is just kind of. Yeah, this isn't required, but it's just kind of a nice to have as far as just logging. Like, we're extracting information from that invoice so we can go. In and upload this to. To a table just to have as a kind of a record in an audit log. And that happens at the end of each of one of these paths, regardless of where it goes. So, yeah, the audit log is a nice feature. Cool. Okay. Sweet. Well, let me. I'll. I'll kick it over to you and let you drive, and we'll start slowly stepping this out. Do you have access to that inbox as well? I don't. So I wonder if, like, I know we were talking about an mvp, but is like an even more bare bones version of an MVP hooking it up to my inbox and then just like, you know, someone on my team where I can even send myself an invoice and we can try it. With the Cooper API to see if it. If it, like, just works on one, and that way we don't have to set up, like, the 50 mailbox things right away. Yes. Yeah, for sure. That's a. We can definitely start there. Definitely start there. So if you share your screen or can build it out in your new brand new enterprise AutomateFlow trial. Lovely. And do we have a heart stop at 9:30? Just we do, but let me. I know Alex, you put some more time for. Was that."

        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Great. Okay, cool. So then we can just start and stub out this zap. And so you can click on. Yep. Start from scratch. Zap. And then set up a trigger here. So this James be Outlook. Yeah. You guys are Outlook, right? Perfect. Look. And then we can just kind of, let's see, trigger event. We want to. Yeah. So for here, what we can do is new email comes in, so we probably don't want to trigger it on every new email. I think let me triggers with an email messages. Yeah. You can do new email. Yeah. New message in in folder. That could be a good way to do it. Well, would that mean we'd have to move the emails we think are relevant to a folder? So for the mvp. Right. So if they're forwarding it to you or fording into your inbox, then, you know, would you want a way to say, like, don't trigger on every email you receive. Right. Just trigger on the ones that get forwarded that are relevant. Yeah, but I think so. Maybe for the bare bones MVP version that could FlowBuilder sense for the eventual solution we would want it to. It would, I guess, have to be reading through every email, which is probably not the most cost efficient, but it would have to flag like here's the email. Does it have attachment? Yes or no is probably going to be what helps us determine whether it's an invoice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah. For the, for the final solution would be new email. And then the second step would be kind of a filter. So triggers don't consume tasks and a filter is a. Doesn't don't consume tasks either. So for now, just to. Yeah. Or I can even do like new flagged or new message. And folder. Everyone's fine. Yeah. Student who flagged that might be best. I don't have an admin account. Okay, weird. And it's not. If we can always just leave this, we can just start stubbing it out and we can come back and try to work through the actual connections. That's probably something I should. Investigate on our side. Because the event for the eventual solution. Yeah, like we James need to have security. Okay. Basically a third party access to all of our emails coming through those inboxes. Yeah, yeah. And you can, when you. Anyone can add a connection into AutomateFlow, like an app connection, without having to build a zap, and then it can share it with admins or with you specifically. And so I can provide those instructions, too, to kind of manage Async. Okay, well, maybe. Is it easier if I just connect to, like, a personal Gmail or something for now? Whatever. Whatever works. Yeah. Especially for testing it. Yeah. Like, just for. Because we want. I think we want a functioning demo. Yeah, that would be awesome. Oh, and they have new attachment. Yeah, I like new start email too. That's cool. But new attachment is good. Okay? Cool. I don't know if you have a pre made label yet, but. If I just. If I set it to blank, it's just going to read everything. Elle. Yes. Yeah. You in the setup. You can just do new start. That way. It just doesn't need much. Yeah. New start email. There we go. Okay. And then, yeah, go ahead and test it. So all this is doing just making sure. It's like if it. If you have a start email in there or pull in that record so we can use for future steps. If you have an email. An invoice. Yeah, Maybe we do that after. Yeah. Yeah, I can look for one, let you know. And that'd be perfect. Maybe I have one. Hang on. Actually, I was. I. I do have one, but it is like a company invoice, so probably James create like a dummy one based off of that if I'm sending it to my personal so I can do that. Sure? Yeah. And then we can go from here into. What we want to look for is AI. Let's do AutomateFlow AI by AutomateFlow. Okay. And then for now, like, we can leave this free. Yeah, leave it on. Just a pre oro prompt is. So this James be we can really refine this based on what the email looks like, but it'd be as. So do you know if it'll always be an attachment or it'll just sometimes be in the body itself? I need to investigate. My hypothesis is it's probably most of the time coming in an attachment. Okay, which isn't a problem. And we could always do branching, too, before this step. To say, like, is it an attachment? Read this file. Is it not? So within this step, you can say looking at the. If you scroll up just a little bit. So the input fields here. We can say. Yeah, the invoice just called. Invoice? And then backslash. And then what we want to look at. If you scroll down through that first step. So these are all the values coming from this email. Right. So you can test with specific emails. In this case, it's just, I think it's just a made up one. And so we can search. Yeah. So click on attachments all the way down at the bottom. So attachments array doesn't look like there's any attachments, so that's fine. We'll use that. And if it'll populate in the future, And then we can say this is a file. Save. And then the prompt James be something, for now, fairly basic to say, you know, extract. Extract the data. Extract the invoice data from the included file. And have it and put it in a structured output, essentially. And at the very kind of high level for now. Which I think is probably fine. And then you can click Generate Preview on the right. So this obviously won't do anything because we don't have any data. One of the things I always do when working with these kind of steps is just use use like another chatgpt or Claude to say hey, write me a prompt that is good for this. Saves a lot of time. So we'll click finish. Cool. And then right here James be webhooks. It always is. My perks. Yeah. Kind of in the middle. Or you can type in the search bar. Cool. And this James be where we start to look. We look at Coopa and see if there's a matching API or a matching invoice for this or matching purchase order. Excuse me. Matcha. Okay. All right. Sounds good. I know we're at time. This is super helpful. I'm going to. I'm going to, I guess, think about the best way for us to test it with, like, an actual live something and Koopa. Maybe I can just, like, grab a number and then put that into. The dummy invoice or something. We can see that does the matching properly. So I James give that some thought and then come to our 4:00 with more."

Good morning.  \nThem: Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Here I am.  \nMe: Also happy to have you join, but also feel free to drop if you have other stuff you want to, because I think we're not going to at all be talking technical stuff yet. More so like evaluation criteria. Happy to have you on give input on that, but also happy to give the time back. If you don't want to join.  \nThem: Yeah. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I definitely listen in. I think it's always good for me to learn.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Can you hear the rain?  \nMe: No, I cannot. Is it pretty bad? The storm started.  \nThem: It's not bad. It's just I'm shed with a tin roof, and so if it does get bad, I probably have to switch to bows or something.  \nMe: Oh, no. Yeah, it's pretty. The voice. The noise canceling is pretty good. I don't hear it at all.  \nThem: Good, good. Good.  \nMe: It's kind of wild. I don't know, that kind of thing. I feel like even five, ten years ago was really hard and we all expected, and it's not even. I don't know, it just happened to the background.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah, it's. Crazy. New norms. I was just talking to my buddy this morning. He runs a dock company. Like, they build docs on lakes. He's talking about sales, and he's like, oh, that's crazy. You guys just. He's like, do you do it over, like, Skype or something? And I'm like, zoom. But. Yeah. Yeah. We've never seen anybody in person. Almost never. That's crazy.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: So it's funny.  \nMe: I mean, it's probably a bit different when you're building physical things.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Hey. Good morning.  \nMe: Sarah. Good morning. How are you doing?  \nThem: Doing all right. We're having, like, weird weather in Boston. It's like, 15 degrees, and then it's like.  \nMe: Oh, my God. Are you guys. You're probably not affected by that big snowstorm coming this weekend, right? Because that's probably farther south.  \nThem: I think we. We're supposed to be. To some extent, we'll see whether it actually materializes.  \nMe: Okay. Well, I guess. I mean, it's also. It's always doing in Boston, and so it's like, that's not even.  \nThem: Miserable.  \nMe: I don't think we'll need the full hour for this. Could you maybe just, like, Sar, could you just, like, walk me a bit through, like, hey, how did the conversation with Robert go? Like, what was the like, what was the feedback? How are they thinking about the evaluation? And honestly, like, full transparency when I'M a little afraid of is like a world where we invest a lot in an evaluation, but there's always going to be workado because, like, oh, they have a. You have a solution already. And so the switching cost is just too much effort to like, go through. And so when I was sort of understand, like, hey. Like, what are the criteria that, like, might or could actually move the needle? Or is it just, like, they just don't want to switch, and that's kind of where we are, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yeah. No, I, I don't. I think Robert's mindset is very much like. And you kind of heard some of this on the call. Like, sometimes that that team and this, the workout of decision happened before I came on, tended to rush into decisions and contracts. And so I don't think he's of the mind that, like, just because we already started building, like that sunk cost, right? That sun cost fallacy. I think he's more concerned with making the right decision from a long term perspective. And he was like, well, do we feel like, you know, we can confidently FlowBuilder a recommendation at this point that either we're caught at or AutomateFlow is the right, like, long term solution, that if we then open this up, to all of our employees and citizen developers in Q3 that, you know, this is going to be the easiest to use platform. And I was like, well, you know, I can tell, like, this is what I heard in the demo. And here's the compare and contrast. But like, you don't really know until you get in there and build. And so I think that's the purpose of it is.  \nMe: There we have. Yeah.  \nThem: Actually do more of, like, I think the things that James really move the needle are, like, how usable, like, is it actually if we start to get multiple people on the IT team using IT and building their own zaps. Which is why I spent some time with Jordan yesterday, trying to, like, maybe troubleshoot some of what Robert was doing because he was like, oh, I, like, tried to build the same zap that Jordan was demoing after the call, and I ran into some issues.  \nMe: Yeah. That's a common.  \nThem: Yeah. He was like, I set it up. And like, it. It told me that I have lunch every day. And it kept asking me, like, who are you going to have lunch with today? I'm like, I'm sure there's something that, you know, is wrong in the way that he's setting it up.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I think it's kind of.  \nMe: And the whole point is, like, we want to. We can help him, you know, like, have that conversation, have our Robert on a call, have Jordan with him on a call as he's doing that, like, that type of stuff.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. So I think, like, the usability and actually, like, showing people like Robert on our team that, like, this is going to be easy because I think he's actually, like, compared to some of the other executives I've seen more technically savvy. Like, I've been on calls where they're like, okay, well, like, I don't know how to find my, like, teams meeting transcripts. I'm like, oh, my God. Okay, like, let's walk you through it step by step. And this is, like, the COO of some function, right? So, yeah, there's going to be, like, a wide range, so I think, like, bringing people along on the feasibility and then having confidence that, like, the, the, like the connections and the invoice assistant that we build, like, actually works and works well.  \nMe: Yeah. Y. Eah.  \nThem: I think is going to be like the biggest proof point. And I think also hopefully that gives us some data points to say, like here was the comparison with like how easy or how difficult it was to set that up in Workado vs AutomateFlow. I think the other thing is because they are charging no cost for year one of. Of development. Like, it's kind of like, well, why wouldn't we?  \nMe: Y. Eah. Well, yeah, and I guess, do you have any information on, like, how is that Workado contract structured? And in particular, like, I guess what we often see when we, when we're like sort of heads up against Workado is they, they basically charge you per automation. Right? So they're like, we'll build them. For free, but your cost scales with each new one. Versus that's like, not the model with us. I'm curious how they have. Are they, like, talking about adjusting that or, like. Or anything?  \nThem: Correct. No. So the contract right now. Is primarily paying for. I think it's called work Auto Go as a product. So it's the like, orchestration. We're primarily using it to FlowBuilder sure that data syncs up between core enterprise applications. And then in the contract, it says, like, for year one, if you want to build genies, We'll do that for free. But it's not like I know Fang was picking in the demo on like having Jordan hours and the increments for scaling up on that TAM support. I mean, they're not explicit about it. I actually am not impressed at all with their customer support. So I think it's a little bit of, like, they say they include the, you know, hands on, like, build assistance for free, but when you actually put it down on paper, it's going to be far less than six or 12 hours. And, like, there's a quality reference there too.  \nMe: And I guess maybe another clarifying question. So is, is are you just having to build this twice this this quarter is effectively what's happening like? Or is it like. Yeah, could you talk to me a bit about.  \nThem: A bit. Yeah. So I think. I think the thought is, like, we're not, you know, we understand that there's going to be some, like, rebuild required with this solution, but that it's better to do that in, like, a very constrained, Q1, low cost kind of way than it is to, like, move forward. With, you know, one particular platform and they realize it's not the right decision and then have to scale back like a whole bunch of citizen development. So I think the thought is on the software license optimization side also. The other thing I found out over the course of the past week is that Jordan had some contractors already start building the software licensing agent in Workado. And I did not know that. So there's more, even more sunk cost on like, oh, but like, they already started building. And he said to me, he was like, I'm not tied to any one platform. I'm like, you clearly are. And now I'm having to kind of, like, work around that. But at the end of the day, like, Robert is the decision maker. I am the decision maker on the agent platform. He is not. But I would like to FlowBuilder sure we're not, like, wasting resources.  \nMe: For sure. Yeah. And I guess, I mean, honestly, full transparency, like, if. If the alternative is, like, they're. If they have people on the workado side building it for you, like, we can do that, too, right? Like, that's. That's an option that we have with our. With the. With the way our.  \nThem: They're not. They're not really like they say they are, providing that build support, but it's not. I think it's. It's primarily the one contractor on our team that's been building it, and then I guess he's been asking them for advice or something. I don't. Know what the working model has been, but I don't play that involved.  \nMe: Totally. Okay, if you don't know yet, like, how far along are they on that build process? Do you know? Like, are they, like. Is it, like, connected and working? Are they just, like. Just started?  \nThem: I asked them for a call later today. So that's my one hour after this is to kind of dig into that and understand a little bit more of, like, where they're at.  \nMe: Okay? Okay?  \nThem: So, like, I. I think given what's happened, the license optimization genie that they started building in Mercado, I'm like, okay, fine. Like, let's just do that then and figure out how that works. And I want to be, like, more involved in the process and be learning and try to also, like, then. I would, like, take those learnings and build out the. Try to build out the invoice assistant myself and see, like, how far that goes. I think on the AutomateFlow side, if we focus on the invoice assistant build, you know, we can kind of have learnings in a more use case driven way. That's like. And, you know, I don't want to. I don't think it feels right to me to, like, engage you guys without any, like, to just kind of give you the run around. Right. So I do want to FlowBuilder sure, like, we find something contract wise that, you know, makes sense for Q1. And we can FlowBuilder that build support and usage and structure that in a way that feels right for both groups.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I think. I think that's right. Okay, this is all super helpful. So what I'm. Let me play back sort of what I'm thinking for tomorrow conversation and see if you're aligned. So there's one piece of. Hey, this is what it would cost to do a month, I think I don't. Have a specific number there, but I'm thinking basically, like, a quarter of what the entire amount was, give or take, as a starting point. And we can. We can work with you guys around, like, what. What that right amount is, but I honestly think what's more important. Is getting really sharp on. These are the criteria we're going to use.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: To, like, judge an evaluation. And sort of this is like the process because what you've laid out, admittedly a little biased, but I do think AutomateFlow is gonna would be better positioned, particularly if citizen development is a thing that like, you guys care about, if ease of use and build is a thing that you guys care about, and then also, I want to find some way to bake in. Like, we'll do multiple of these because I think that's also, like, a key differentiator for us. Right? Because, like, you know, when it's all centralized, workout of work, still build those genies for you. But when, when we get to a world, even if it's a year from now where you have citizen development, I don't think workado, like, has the capability. Like, I mean, again, like, I'm sure they'll frame some capability to do it, but, like, I don't think they have the world in which every person know Horizon Ventures companies. Is able to use AutomateFlow, like, or use, use Workado to like, build their own personal agents and all that stuff. So I would, I think having the, the one we talked about, like, I think I post texting you this morning. I think I would love to include even a second or even third, like, or maybe I don't know if this is, like, too much, but, like, just give us the, like, list and see who can go through, like, more of them in the three months type thing, because I think that is where we're potentially official. The other thing is, I would love to do and again, like, we can FlowBuilder this like a criteria for both. Even just an hour workshop with the exec, with the executive team, where it's like, hey, like, let's get you building a zap. Building a. Building an agent in some 30 minute. Like, actually, no, like an hour period. And we do those kind of workshops, like, all the time and. So that James help, like, click. Okay, this is how this makes sense. All any of the bugs that they're running into as they're building. Like, we help them work through that in real time, and then that, I think, often lowers the barrier going forward.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: I think so, yeah. Those, those two, I think major adjustments, like, to the, like, criteria, I think would help us, like, FlowBuilder the case of, like, why AutomateFlow could FlowBuilder sense. And then I guess the only other thing for me would be, like, how do we turn the cut off frame? Like, basically, like, how do we get. To the end and not be, like, I'm still not quite sure. Even if, like, there's a rubric. I don't know if that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, I don't think that. Yeah, I know. I think there's two, like, scenarios to mitigate for. One is that for sure? The other one is, like, I wouldn't want to, you know, kind of sign up for a year, and at the end of it, we're like, oh, actually. Like there's not a long term thing. So I think like getting the buy in to and having a little bit more time to build like confidence across the rest of the team, they're like, oh, I'm super excited for this. Like, I want to be a champion for it within it. And like, honestly, I I'm a little, like, fed up with just dealing with the whole, like, workado. They've, like, really just. They. They do basically dove off the deep end without Robert and I knowing, which feels wrong to me. And I'm like, okay, I don't. It's getting political, like, to just, like, right? The ship and have some structure to how we're going to do that. Because I don't think that, like, getting thing on another call and us like, working through it.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: I mean, it might end up. It might result in, like, us sending a contract, but it's not going to FlowBuilder my life easy.  \nMe: Easier. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.  \nThem: In the long run. So I'd rather have there be, like, enough. Enough, like, proof points for us to be like, okay, like, let's put this to bed once in a and for all. Because it's not just, like, him that's kind of going off and doing this. Like, he's bringing multiple. People on his team along and like having them spend time on it. So, yeah.  \nMe: That makes sense. So it sounds like the people, like, obviously, like, you need to approve the criteria. Robert it sounds like getting frantically, like, I agree in these criteria. Even if he, like, that would be important, right? For him to say, like, these. These, like, yes. These are, like, things that we're looking for in a system. Whether that's. You guys or Mercado, theoretically. And then.  \nThem: Y. Eah.  \nMe: Laying out, like, okay, here are the, like, it basically, like, here's, like, how we're making the decision, how we're actually going to FlowBuilder the decision, or, like, what the, like, thresholds that we need to see to, like, FlowBuilder that decision.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Be honest with, like, we can sidebar on this if, like, the approach makes zero sense and you're just like, Sarah seems super confused and maybe, like, she needs some advice on how to handle this better. I just.  \nMe: I don't think your approach is confused. I mean, full transparency. I was a little surprised up to now that we workado hadn't done anything like this. And so this is like, you know, it happens in competitive situations. I think. I think the approach you're laying out is right. And really, I think it's just like, hey, how do we FlowBuilder sure that the criteria are set up, like, appropriately like that we're measuring the real things? Again. Sorry. I realize I'm, like, really biased. Like, obviously, I'm a salesperson, so, like, I want us to win, but, like, we want the criteria to be, like, what you just described are things that I think we can do in Riccato. Camp, right?  \nThem: I think there are, like, targeted people on the team at the leadership level. Like, Fang's boss came to me the other day and was like, I have 2,000 unread emails. I, like, really want something that helps me categorize them. Can you show me how to. So, like, you know, I showed him how. To set it up and like chat GPT. But I'm like, we should get you in a platform that can help you do this in an automated way so you're not having to that prompt every time. So I think they're like targeted kind of sessions we could do with people on the team to kind of bring, like, build.  \nMe: Yeah. Honestly, if that. Because I feel like. Didn't Robert also, like, I feel like what he mentioned was, like, a similar type of workflow where he was like, I was trying to summarize my emails or look at meetings or something like that. That's something like, hey, we can do, like, an executive productivity session, right? Like, maybe. Invite. Like, I don't know how many it would be. Maybe it's like, 5 to 10 of your C suite and, like, the level below and, like, hey, in an hour, we'll get you some agents that can, like, summarize your inboxes for you and, like, help you prep for meetings without. Like, having to do a lot of work, and that's like, the kind of thing we can. I would. I think we can build that into, like, at least one workshop, like, during this three month period, because that's going to be important once we get to the citizen development piece, even if we're not like. Doing that yet.  \nThem: Yeah. And I think, like, maybe we can work on what does it look like to kind of troubleshoot some of the potential kinks in our environment before that? Because I think where you, like, you lose. You lose people very quickly if they're like, oh, and then I have to do this. Microsoft permissions and wait. Like, two days for the security team to approve it, and then we've. We've lost them. So I think just, yeah, if we can work out, like. And Jordan and I started, like, building this yesterday, just, like, what's the right way to frame it also, so that just doesn't feel as, like, overwhelming. Like I told him, like, Jordan, I know you know exactly whether to choose, like, a web hook or, you know, AI stuff or, like, all these things.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: For Robert building it. He's like, I have no idea what should be an outlook step or an AI step or, you know.  \nMe: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.  \nThem: Yeah. Alex touched on those workshops that we've done over and over again. And that's always, like, the first part of it. It's like, here's, you know, here's. Here's how you think about it in your head. And then also here's how you might even think about a framework for what should you even do? Like, what should you automate? Right. Things that are repeatable, annoying, or predictable. And hand those tools, too. And it's. It's really helpful. Totally. So, Alex, I don't know. Like, what? What do you think? Or maybe you need to go back to the team and chat a little bit more about, like, what do you think pricing or a structure could look like for us?  \nMe: I mean, I need to get, like, specifics, but I. If. If it's reasonable for you, I'm thinking just like a quarter of the amounts. Like 20k for the 3 months is kind of what I'm thinking about right now. If that's, like, right range.  \nThem: Okay? Yeah, and that would. And so that would still include the, like, TAM hours. It would be, like, structured as TAM hours and credit usage, essentially.  \nMe: Yeah. And again, I need to confirm because we don't. Pilots are like a little different, like, structurally. But it would, it would effectively be a three month version of the year contract that we were looking at is kind of what I'm thinking about.  \nThem: Okay? And.  \nMe: Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Like, come. Come back to me and confirm. The one thing I want to FlowBuilder sure I understand in that is for the credit usage piece, because I don't know, like, once we build these, how many we're going to actually use, but I imagine it's going to be a lot lower volume. Wise than what you and I actually discussed. So James that be, like. James the contract be split out into, like, here's the TAM time portion and then here's the credit portion, like, up to this amount, but incurred based on usage.  \nMe: Yeah. For sure. So full transparency. What we would probably want to do is just say, like, hey, basically you were the plan would be you have the same 600k credits for the year and like during the pilot James like consume however many we use them. If we transition to a full enterprise agreement, we'll just have those James be like the credits that were used in the. In the. In those two months, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Okay? So it would be like the full year is represented as a cap.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then. Okay, it's. It's just the consumable portion towards that.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Okay? Sounds good. And I think, like, I'm happy to put forward the MSA with the legal team to. Based on my conversation with Robert yesterday, I think he feels comfortable with us moving ahead with the court. I mean, obviously, he'll still need to kind of look at the contract, but I don't know if he accepted. The meeting tomorrow is what I.  \nMe: Yeah. I think he did. Yeah, because he actually did the suggestion to move in 30 minutes earlier.  \nThem: Oh, okay, great. All right. Sounds good. Yeah, we can. That's awesome.  \nMe: Okay, now this is. This is helpful. So next steps, I'm going to go talk to our, like, internal, like, deal pricing team and be like, hey, can we put this offer together? Then I am going to basically put together, like, this is what I think the evaluation should include based off of, like, what I've heard from Sarah from our last conversation. These are the things that are important. Want to FlowBuilder sure aligned. Okay, if so, these are the boxes we're trying to check over the next three. Months. If yes. Okay. This is how much it would cost to, like for us to do that.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Is kind of how I'm thinking about it. I'll. I'll pull that together, share with you, but I think. I think we're on the same page in terms of, like, what criteria to add. It's like multiple builds, team in team development, ease of use. Right. It's kind of like.  \nThem: I wouldn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And include, like, Price Security.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay, that does FlowBuilder sense. Like, sort of like the. In my head, like the. Yeah, like the basic security components of the system. Yeah. We need to pull all that stuff in. That makes sense. Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. One of the contractors on their team. I think he might just be misinformed, but I started pinging him yesterday to understand where he. Where he was at, and I asked him, like, have you had experience working in AutomateFlow instead of Workado before? And he said,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: There's a difference in security and compliance features around data residency options, retention time, data masking options, and external log streaming. That has traditionally been where I've seen work how to differentiates. But it's been a minute since I compared those to what AutomateFlow provides, and I was kind of like, wouldn't those things just be covered in the msa, like.  \nMe: Yeah. So, I mean, so to be fair, AutomateFlow, like, if he's probably, if he use AutomateFlow even three, four years ago, he. That probably were, like, things that we as a company were not thinking about at the time, but we've done, like, a lot of work over the last several years to build like basic. What we. I would consider those, like, what I would call basic enterprise features. Right. If you're selling to any large company, like, you need data, residency requirements, you need to be specific about where things are being housed, all that kind of stuff. So understand why he would think that. But we have a we've? Done work on it.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Okay? Cool.  \nMe: Yeah. So. Yeah, like that. That. Okay, that does FlowBuilder sense. Okay, cool.  \nThem: Awesome. And then I have time with the AP team tomorrow, so come early next week. I should have a lot more detail on, like, the exact process flow that they want built out, and then we can start working on.  \nMe: Sounds good. And then actually, I guess one maybe like, other tactical question. Are they giving you, like, what is their support model going to look like here? Like, super tactically? Because, like, with us, like, you'll obviously, you'll have. You'll have Jordan, you'll have Robert, we'll have the channel. We'll do some of these workshops, like have they said, or they just kind of like, oh, well, we'll do something because you know what I mean?  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. From what I've seen, I think they operate. I mean, they had. They have a channel. It's not really used by our team. Like, I looked at the history and there's like, not in there. So it seems like they just operate based on calls primarily. Like, if we're like, hey, James you hop? On a call. They'll be open to that. And then it's primarily the contractor on Fang's team that I think would be like the build person. And we are, you know, paying for him as a full time contractor, but he's not. He's working on, like, a whole bunch of different things.  \nMe: Anything. Got you. Yeah. And so I guess, maybe is that also potentially part of it? It's like workado. Because, like, with. With us, we're always sort of in a bit of a weird middle ground. If I'm hearing you, I think it actually would be better, at least for these initial use cases, for us to just build them, rather than, like, having you guys sort of learn to build them and then separately, like, help you learn. Get up the curve on, like, how AutomateFlow is easy to use otherwise, is that the right way to think about it, or do you think it'd still be, like, better to, like, have, like, you build it with. With our support, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, either way, I would like to FlowBuilder sure I learn, like, the right way to do things. I think, in both platforms because I think at the end of the day, like, I need to be able to confident, like here that, you know, here are the bright spots and the gaps I saw in both platforms.  \nMe: Yeah. O. Kay.  \nThem: I think, you know. You know, you tell me, like, what. What is the faster path going to be? Because I also, I'm like, okay, now I've committed to coming back, like, March, you know, 31st, the exact team to be like, here are the pilot results, and here's what we found, and here's the ROI implications moving forward. So, yeah, I don't. I don't know what you think James be more efficient.  \nMe: Y. Eah. I guess. Maybe. Maybe what we. Maybe what it is, is, like, we still do the one together. And I'm just. What I'm trying. And part of what I'm trying to be thoughtful about, too, is just, like, I realized doing both of these is just going to be so much time for you. So, like. Maybe we do, like, one together. And, like, the one that you and Jordan had started on, once you have, like, the actual, like, login information, we can, like, get that set up in, like, a real way. And then separately, we work to build maybe that invoice flow or something, or, like, if there's another one. That the team wants to, like, prioritize because of, like, the level of complexity or something. And, like, we just built that one. And so, like, the. So it's like, hey, this is how easy for you to do. And this is what it's like when we just, like, James help you, like, build something.  \nThem: Okay. Yeah, that would be great. I think maybe, like, Jordan, then if you and I can work on the invoice assistant use case, and then if the team can build out the software license one. So, I mean, I actually, I think that's a great idea because then we could say, like. And look at all the. Contractor time and spend that we had on workado, because their support model was primarily have our contractor build it and then have them kind of just advise when. When he needs to, and then, like, there's a chance that they might not really be able to finish on. On time or on budget, so.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Exactly. I mean. I. I hope that, like, it's always bad to say, I hope they don't finish on time, but, like, I. I think that's, like a. A real risk.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: We structure it right, Okay? Cool. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/dc12cc98-1f30-4623-9695-2a5fc1a83d0d](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/dc12cc98-1f30-4623-9695-2a5fc1a83d0d)\n",

And honestly, like, full transparency when I'M a little afraid of is like a world where we invest a lot in an evaluation, but there's always going to be workado because, like, oh, they have a. You have a solution already. And so the switching cost is just too much effort to like, go through. And so when I was sort of understand, like, hey.

And so I don't think he's of the mind that, like, just because we already started building, like that sunk cost, right? That sun cost fallacy. I think he's more concerned with making the right decision from a long term perspective. And he was like, well, do we feel like, you know, we can confidently FlowBuilder a recommendation at this point that either we're caught at or AutomateFlow is the right, like, long term solution, that if we then open this up, to all of our employees and citizen developers in Q3 that, you know, this is going to be the easiest to use platform. And I was like, well, you know, I can tell, like, this is what I heard in the demo. And here's the compare and contrast. But like, you don't really know until you get in there and build.

And I think also hopefully that gives us some data points to say, like here was the comparison with like how easy or how difficult it was to set that up in Workado vs AutomateFlow. I think the other thing is because they are charging no cost for year one of. Of development. Like, it's kind of like, well, why wouldn't we?"

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Y. Eah. Well, yeah, and I guess, do you have any information on, like, how is that Workado contract structured? And in particular, like, I guess what we often see when we, when we're like sort of heads up against Workado is they, they basically charge you per automation. Right? So they're like, we'll build them. For free, but your cost scales with each new one. Versus that's like, not the model with us. I'm curious how they have. Are they, like, talking about adjusting that or, like. Or anything?"
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Correct. No. So the contract right now. Is primarily paying for. I think it's called work Auto Go as a product. So it's the like, orchestration. We're primarily using it to FlowBuilder sure that data syncs up between core enterprise applications. And then in the contract, it says, like, for year one, if you want to build genies, We'll do that for free. But it's not like I know Fang was picking in the demo on like having Jordan hours and the increments for scaling up on that TAM support. I mean, they're not explicit about it. I actually am not impressed at all with their customer support. So I think it's a little bit of, like, they say they include the, you know, hands on, like, build assistance for free, but when you actually put it down on paper, it's going to be far less than six or 12 hours. And, like, there's a quality reference there too."

          "speaker": "me",

        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "A bit. Yeah. So I think. I think the thought is, like, we're not, you know, we understand that there's going to be some, like, rebuild required with this solution, but that it's better to do that in, like, a very constrained, Q1, low cost kind of way than it is to, like, move forward. With, you know, one particular platform and they realize it's not the right decision and then have to scale back like a whole bunch of citizen development. So I think the thought is on the software license optimization side also. The other thing I found out over the course of the past week is that Jordan had some contractors already start building the software licensing agent in Workado. And I did not know that. So there's more, even more sunk cost on like, oh, but like, they already started building. And he said to me, he was like, I'm not tied to any one platform. I'm like, you clearly are. And now I'm having to kind of, like, work around that. But at the end of the day, like, Robert is the decision maker. I am the decision maker on the agent platform. He is not. But I would like to FlowBuilder sure we're not, like, wasting resources."

If they have people on the workado side building it for you, like, we can do that, too, right? Like, that's. That's an option that we have with our. With the. With the way our."

Like, let's just do that then and figure out how that works. And I want to be, like, more involved in the process and be learning and try to also, like, then. I would, like, take those learnings and build out the. Try to build out the invoice assistant myself and see, like, how far that goes. I think on the AutomateFlow side, if we focus on the invoice assistant build, you know, we can kind of have learnings in a more use case driven way. That's like. And, you know, I don't want to. I don't think it feels right to me to, like, engage you guys without any, like, to just kind of give you the run around. Right. So I do want to FlowBuilder sure, like, we find something contract wise that, you know, makes sense for Q1. And we can FlowBuilder that build support and usage and structure that in a way that feels right for both groups."

Have a specific number there, but I'm thinking basically, like, a quarter of what the entire amount was, give or take, as a starting point. And we can. We can work with you guys around, like, what. What that right amount is, but I honestly think what's more important. Is getting really sharp on. These are the criteria we're going to use."

And sort of this is like the process because what you've laid out, admittedly a little biased, but I do think AutomateFlow is gonna would be better positioned, particularly if citizen development is a thing that like, you guys care about, if ease of use and build is a thing that you guys care about, and then also, I want to find some way to bake in. Like, we'll do multiple of these because I think that's also, like, a key differentiator for us. Right? Because, like, you know, when it's all centralized, workout of work, still build those genies for you. But when, when we get to a world, even if it's a year from now where you have citizen development, I don't think workado, like, has the capability. Like, I mean, again, like, I'm sure they'll frame some capability to do it, but, like, I don't think they have the world in which every person know Horizon Ventures companies. Is able to use AutomateFlow, like, or use, use Workado to like, build their own personal agents and all that stuff. So I would, I think having the, the one we talked about, like, I think I post texting you this morning. I think I would love to include even a second or even third, like, or maybe I don't know if this is, like, too much, but, like, just give us the, like, list and see who can go through, like, more of them in the three months type thing, because I think that is where we're potentially official. The other thing is, I would love to do and again, like, we can FlowBuilder this like a criteria for both. Even just an hour workshop with the exec, with the executive team, where it's like, hey, like, let's get you building a zap. Building a. Building an agent in some 30 minute. Like, actually, no, like an hour period. And we do those kind of workshops, like, all the time and. So that James help, like, click. Okay, this is how this makes sense. All any of the bugs that they're running into as they're building. Like, we help them work through that in real time, and then that, I think, often lowers the barrier going forward."

They do basically dove off the deep end without Robert and I knowing, which feels wrong to me. And I'm like, okay, I don't. It's getting political, like, to just, like, right? The ship and have some structure to how we're going to do that. Because I don't think that, like, getting thing on another call and us like, working through it."

Because it's not just, like, him that's kind of going off and doing this. Like, he's bringing multiple. People on his team along and like having them spend time on it. So, yeah."

Even if he, like, that would be important, right? For him to say, like, these. These, like, yes. These are, like, things that we're looking for in a system. Whether that's. You guys or Mercado, theoretically. And then."

And so this is like, you know, it happens in competitive situations. I think. I think the approach you're laying out is right. And really, I think it's just like, hey, how do we FlowBuilder sure that the criteria are set up, like, appropriately like that we're measuring the real things? Again. Sorry. I realize I'm, like, really biased. Like, obviously, I'm a salesperson, so, like, I want us to win, but, like, we want the criteria to be, like, what you just described are things that I think we can do in Riccato. Camp, right?"

I, like, really want something that helps me categorize them. Can you show me how to. So, like, you know, I showed him how. To set it up and like chat GPT. But I'm like, we should get you in a platform that can help you do this in an automated way so you're not having to that prompt every time. So I think they're like targeted kind of sessions we could do with people on the team to kind of bring, like, build."

Didn't Robert also, like, I feel like what he mentioned was, like, a similar type of workflow where he was like, I was trying to summarize my emails or look at meetings or something like that. That's something like, hey, we can do, like, an executive productivity session, right? Like, maybe. Invite. Like, I don't know how many it would be. Maybe it's like, 5 to 10 of your C suite and, like, the level below and, like, hey, in an hour, we'll get you some agents that can, like, summarize your inboxes for you and, like, help you prep for meetings without. Like, having to do a lot of work, and that's like, the kind of thing we can. I would. I think we can build that into, like, at least one workshop, like, during this three month period, because that's going to be important once we get to the citizen development piece, even if we're not like. Doing that yet."

Because I think where you, like, you lose. You lose people very quickly if they're like, oh, and then I have to do this. Microsoft permissions and wait. Like, two days for the security team to approve it, and then we've. We've lost them. So I think just, yeah, if we can work out, like. And Jordan and I started, like, building this yesterday, just, like, what's the right way to frame it also, so that just doesn't feel as, like, overwhelming. Like I told him, like, Jordan, I know you know exactly whether to choose, like, a web hook or, you know, AI stuff or, like, all these things."

Here's how you think about it in your head. And then also here's how you might even think about a framework for what should you even do? Like, what should you automate? Right. Things that are repeatable, annoying, or predictable. And hand those tools, too. And it's. It's really helpful. Totally. So, Alex, I don't know. Like, what? What do you think? Or maybe you need to go back to the team and chat a little bit more about, like, what do you think pricing or a structure could look like for us?"

The one thing I want to FlowBuilder sure I understand in that is for the credit usage piece, because I don't know, like, once we build these, how many we're going to actually use, but I imagine it's going to be a lot lower volume. Wise than what you and I actually discussed. So James that be, like. James the contract be split out into, like, here's the TAM time portion and then here's the credit portion, like, up to this amount, but incurred based on usage."

What we would probably want to do is just say, like, hey, basically you were the plan would be you have the same 600k credits for the year and like during the pilot James like consume however many we use them. If we transition to a full enterprise agreement, we'll just have those James be like the credits that were used in the. In the. In those two months, if that makes sense."

Then I am going to basically put together, like, this is what I think the evaluation should include based off of, like, what I've heard from Sarah from our last conversation. These are the things that are important. Want to FlowBuilder sure aligned. Okay, if so, these are the boxes we're trying to check over the next three. Months. If yes. Okay.

That probably were, like, things that we as a company were not thinking about at the time, but we've done, like, a lot of work over the last several years to build like basic. What we. I would consider those, like, what I would call basic enterprise features. Right. If you're selling to any large company, like, you need data, residency requirements, you need to be specific about where things are being housed, all that kind of stuff. So understand why he would think that. But we have a we've? Done work on it."

        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Sounds good. And then actually, I guess one maybe like, other tactical question. Are they giving you, like, what is their support model going to look like here? Like, super tactically? Because, like, with us, like, you'll obviously, you'll have. You'll have Jordan, you'll have Robert, we'll have the channel. We'll do some of these workshops, like have they said, or they just kind of like, oh, well, we'll do something because you know what I mean?"

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. Yeah. From what I've seen, I think they operate. I mean, they had. They have a channel. It's not really used by our team. Like, I looked at the history and there's like, not in there. So it seems like they just operate based on calls primarily. Like, if we're like, hey, James you hop? On a call. They'll be open to that. And then it's primarily the contractor on Fang's team that I think would be like the build person. And we are, you know, paying for him as a full time contractor, but he's not. He's working on, like, a whole bunch of different things."

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Anything. Got you. Yeah. And so I guess, maybe is that also potentially part of it? It's like workado. Because, like, with. With us, we're always sort of in a bit of a weird middle ground. If I'm hearing you, I think it actually would be better, at least for these initial use cases, for us to just build them, rather than, like, having you guys sort of learn to build them and then separately, like, help you learn. Get up the curve on, like, how AutomateFlow is easy to use otherwise, is that the right way to think about it, or do you think it'd still be, like, better to, like, have, like, you build it with. With our support, if that makes sense."

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. I mean, either way, I would like to FlowBuilder sure I learn, like, the right way to do things. I think, in both platforms because I think at the end of the day, like, I need to be able to confident, like here that, you know, here are the bright spots and the gaps I saw in both platforms."

Because I also, I'm like, okay, now I've committed to coming back, like, March, you know, 31st, the exact team to be like, here are the pilot results, and here's what we found, and here's the ROI implications moving forward. So, yeah, I don't. I don't know what you think James be more efficient."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Y. Eah. I guess. Maybe. Maybe what we. Maybe what it is, is, like, we still do the one together. And I'm just. What I'm trying. And part of what I'm trying to be thoughtful about, too, is just, like, I realized doing both of these is just going to be so much time for you. So, like. Maybe we do, like, one together. And, like, the one that you and Jordan had started on, once you have, like, the actual, like, login information, we can, like, get that set up in, like, a real way. And then separately, we work to build maybe that invoice flow or something, or, like, if there's another one. That the team wants to, like, prioritize because of, like, the level of complexity or something. And, like, we just built that one. And so, like, the. So it's like, hey, this is how easy for you to do. And this is what it's like when we just, like, James help you, like, build something."

          "text": "Okay. Yeah, that would be great. I think maybe, like, Jordan, then if you and I can work on the invoice assistant use case, and then if the team can build out the software license one. So, I mean, I actually, I think that's a great idea because then we could say, like. And look at all the. Contractor time and spend that we had on workado, because their support model was primarily have our contractor build it and then have them kind of just advise when. When he needs to, and then, like, there's a chance that they might not really be able to finish on. On time or on budget, so."

We James run a 3-month pilot for x amount; that's a premium over the normal. The other option is to sign a yearly agreement and give you guys an opt-out clause, which is with the solutions architect is an opt-out clause\n\nI've heard that you put a lot in to IntegrateHub and this is now you're paying for 2 systems on things going live, push the deal and let's get to that workflow or we could push the conversation to a pilot and lay out these are the very strict requirements, what do we have to do that in the end of \n\nWe have the technical requirements to get it live, we can stress test in that kind of space, this my understanding from Jordan to get the workflow up and running.\n\nIn a situation like this for 80K we're not going to look at for a pilot for things like this, we FlowBuilder this an AITP plan, we do a pilot where there enterprise plan is a pilot that we have, where we're seeing and framing the value\n\n## Meeting Notes\n\n### Strategy for tomorrow’s KR Horizon Ventures meeting\n\n- Present full 80k pricing first before pilot discussion\n  - Show complete value proposition and full year offer\n  - Test if budget range is realistic before moving to pilot\n  - Don’t get trapped in pilot-only commercial discussion\n- No pilot pricing prepared for tomorrow’s call\n  - Requirements unclear for short-term evaluation period\n  - Pilot pricing should be premium over prorated monthly rate\n  - Need their specific requirements first to price appropriately\n- Alternative positioning options:\n  1.

Sorry I haven't got back to Horizon Ventures pioneering. I know. I kind of left some notes yesterday and then didn't get to it, so. Falling a little bit. But yeah, so a couple things on that I was thinking was I actually think or. Yeah, give me. Do you mind if I get a little bit of a digest on the decision where it is? And then I'll give my point of view of tomorrow.  \nMe: Yeah, for sure. The best place art is short version is Robert. Their CIO has felt like in the past they bought software too quickly and so he wants to FlowBuilder sure that if they're buying an automation, like an AI platform, that it is something that they can actually use in the medium to long term. And so if I think about what we were scoping when Sarah originally reached out, it was very much focused on, hey, how do we quickly get you these two or three use cases up and running and actually just get those built.  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: And that framing. They felt they were like, oh, can we just have work how to do some of this stuff? And that is why I think they want to do a sort of, like, side by side comparison. My push. That was, I think, the impetus. Of it.  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: Talks to AD Today to get just like, hey, tell me. Tell me about what happened here.  \nThem: Y. Eah.  \nMe: Apparently the workado team had been working in the background to start building the work use case that we were talking about.  \nThem: Y. Ep. Yep.  \nMe: They were just, like, in the background trying to do that. Unclear how far along they are in that process, but they're trying to position it as, like, oh, like, you know, we can just do this one, so you don't need to, like, use AutomateFlow for anything like that.  \nThem: Y. Ep. Yep.  \nMe: So with that context, I was like, okay, high level. That makes sense. Initially, she had said, oh, they want to compare us using that one use case against them doing that one use case. And my push was like, I don't think that's a good comparison, because what you're talking about is, like, hit someone. On your IT team or someone I work auto build that. That's not the same as Are we enabling your entire organization to actually be able to use AI?  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: I'm trying to shape the criteria here, so it's focused around citizen development as one of the key factors, and also speed of implementation as one of the key factors here. I'll pause there if there are any follow up questions.  \nThem: Yeah. What is there, like, what is your work auto deal like? How does. How does. How is that structured?  \nMe: The Work Auto deal is based off of. They have what's called Workado Go. And you were saying, which is like, connects to a few of their systems. That's like playing in the background. And then they are offering them for free. What. What they're calling genes, which are. Which I think would be like. These specific use cases. And so each specific use case would be like a net new charge for them.  \nThem: Yeah. Do you know what that charge is? Or have you?  \nMe: I've asked for details on that. I don't know. We've gotten, like, specific numbers on that.  \nThem: So here's my view on. Yeah. Okay. All right, and then. How are they thinking about, like, requirements? How are they thinking about, like, Like what needs to be proved after that time. Time period.  \nMe: I. Think. I don't think they have a good sense of. Sense of that yet transparently so. Part of my goal tomorrow is to push them towards that. I don't think. I think they have a vague sense of the things that they, that they want to know. But we haven't gotten a clear like, hey, this is the specific list of things that we need to confirm.  \nThem: Yeah. Okay? Okay. I think that's a good. Good background. Do you know what their spend is with work? Auto? You don't have that either, do you?  \nMe: No. I don't.  \nThem: Okay? All right. Okay. So I think when I was thinking about this today, I was like, there's kind of two ways that we can go through this, right? Which is. Or net Net. What I think is. I don't think you need a go to a commercial discussion tomorrow if it's going to be a pilot.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Is my view.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: I wonder if, like, I wonder if it still is. I'm. I wonder if it still is. Presenting our platform at the price that you actually talked about before and saying, hey, here's the thing. We need to go back and talk about the pilot and what it's going to be. And we were ready to, you know, provide. And I'm interested in what you think about actually going ahead and pricing this or not, or, you know, going through the pricing tomorrow or not. But I. What I don't like, what I don't feel aligned on is I don't think you need to have pricing for pilots tomorrow.  \nMe: Down.  \nThem: So in my view, the call either needs to get to. Hey, do you think there's value in this? Like, we're actually willing to, like, frontend some costs. We're willing to, like, you know, we have high conviction that this is going to get through within, like, these, you know, use cases are going to go through within. How did that conversation go with Jordan and Sarah, essentially, for the like, use case and actually building out.  \nMe: I think I would say my impression is it went okay, but not great. I think part of it is, like, they're actually getting implemented. Feels messier than maybe the picture that they were imagining, like, oh, like, how do we actually get the data connected? There's someone in 19 that has, like, approve this stuff, like, all those types of things, like FlowBuilder it feel slower.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: So I think that is one thing we'll need to be in that I talk to him about this today is like, when we're working on building with them, we need to, like, FlowBuilder sure that stuff is, like, buttoned up beforehand so we can go into those conversations. Prepared.  \nThem: Got it. Yeah. So I'm just wondering if. Okay, so that's also the stance that's there on, which is, hey, I'm like, a little concern. Is like, I'm trying to figure out, like, the validity of actually going to pilot pricing tomorrow, whereas we just say, hey, just so you know, We can't price a pilot right now because, like, because of the. Like, we can't price the pilot right now because we're running into, like. We don't really know what your, like, exact requirements for the short period of time is. We also feel like we could actually provide all this value. You can get to it quickly. And I think the concern that you guys have is on workado today. Like. Like we can even say like, because this conversation just happened. We're not like we're not in a position to even provide you a pilot price. So. That's. That's one thing I'm just thinking about is do we even go ahead and price this deal tomorrow? Like. Maybe.  \nMe: Sorry.  \nThem: And if it's. And we need to get that in the call tomorrow, and if they're like, Like, I do want to see, like, what their requirements are, and pilot requirements are usually different. And in that case, we should. Yeah. We should not have a pilot price ready for tomorrow. What we hear tomorrow should guide that price.  \nMe: I guess the only thing I'm potentially concerned about is. The timeline piece of it in terms of, like, if we don't give them a number on, like, hey, this is how much it would cost. I don't know if they. Or are you just saying, like, hey, where the price point, you know, is the 80k for the year, we're going to do a pilot with you, and then at the end of that pilot, we're going to need to pilot with you. We're not going to, like, charge you for anything that that pilot we want. We're going to do an ADK contract. Assuming we come to an agreement.  \nThem: Sorry. I think I'm a little bit here. Once.  \nMe: Oh, wait. Sorry. As the. Is the audio going out? Can you hear me?  \nThem: No, I'm driving. So I think that's, that's part of the issue here. So it was on me, but, okay, so I think I heard, like, if they don't have a price, that's going to be, like, a little bit of a challenge. And secondly, we're going to run into. This challenge with. I think there's another one that I didn't hear.  \nMe: No, I guess the. I was asking if. The way, the way I could see it, not having a price or at least my initial up nothing price would be okay is if we could say then, hey, we're just going to do the pilot for you. I guess what I said differently, I would want to be able to walk out of the meeting Friday with like. A. This is what it takes for us to, like, actually execute on a pilot with you guys? If that makes sense.  \nThem: Yep, exactly. Yeah, I'm trying to figure out. Yes. So I. I'm aligned, and, like, that's what you need to get out of the pilot. What are you thinking about in terms of commercials? And presenting commercials.  \nMe: Actually your comment just now, as I do think it makes sense to still present that like this was the, this was going to be the full offer. Like, that page. And then I think the new, like, I added the page that I was going to show was just like, so for a pilot, we can do, like, 25 of that for the two months because. And it's more than just like, a prorated monthly rate, because it's like, there's the. Uncertainty involved. So when we do pilots, we have to, like, price it at a higher than whatever the prorated rate would be. Is kind of how I was thinking about bringing that.  \nThem: Yeah. Yep. I agree that a pilot should be higher. I mean, you could also go into, hey, this is like the pricing that we have. Is this something that is within your budget for a product that works? Right? And it's like. Because the thing is, like, we're not even in. Like, we don't even go into a pilot discussion if they think it's going to be 15k. Right. Like, I think that's the other thing, like, you should consider is, like, we don't even get into a pilot conversation if they're like, nope, I can't even do, like, I thought this was going to be a 20k product. And then you're like, no. Totally off on value proposition, and, like, that's on us because, like, we're not proving enough ROI in your business. So that's why. That's why I feel that going into tomorrow with Pilot Price, Is going to set up, like, set up the conversation for yes. Let's like, oh, let's do a pilot, but then you're just going to go into commercials of that pilot. And. Like I almost feel like. Yeah.  \nMe: Makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. So that's why I was like, I don't think I saw, like, the, like, I know you're talking to Grady and so forth in the dsr, but I was like, we probably don't need to go there until we have the conversation tomorrow. How we structure that, I think is going to be if we price it tomorrow or not. I think the full price makes sense. Maybe it's just going to be. I have not looked at the whole thread but like but be able if Jordan joining the call tomorrow or not?  \nMe: Yes, same. Same as you.  \nThem: Okay? Is Jordan. Jordan's in Jordan's east coast. But if you don't mind, just. Yeah, maybe if you do have time to sync with him, it might just help to be like. Okay, like, how did the. Like, I didn't get a good sense just like you said on the build, and that's. Why I like having sellers in that call. That's why I even asked, like, if you were on it yesterday, is because then you get a sense of like, okay. They're like, oh, this is a small thing. Like, we can get to it. Like, you probably have a better read than even a say of, like, okay. They still feel like it's easy. They just need, like, more hours to just get this sorted, which is still good because you're like, hey, 12 hours of jam, like, in that time, like, obviously, we'll solve it. Like, you probably are proving this. Or it was like, oh, it feels really slow. It feels really. Challenging right now, and that's a totally different positioning of it. Because I'm hoping that it's the first. Right. Which is like, oh, yeah, like the architecture is there. We essentially can prove this. Generally, we usually don't do a pilot because there's like. And maybe the talk track I'm thinking about is we are a citizen development platform, too. I'm an AI orchestration layer. You don't really get, you know, hundreds of people on a platform or, like, multiple people on a platform. And be like, it's a pilot. Like, we need to actually figure this out right now. And maybe that is just. Let's just get to use case quicker. Like, you could even slow down the deal and say, well, what's the use case that we need to get? Like, we need to either prove that we can do or we can. We have to. Get close enough to get to signature, and I wonder if we can, like, get those out tomorrow.  \nMe: And I guess maybe just, like, clarifying points. So you're saying, like, don't even position a pilot? At all. I guess, transparently, the one thing I'm concerned about is, like, because. Saying to, like, do it for them. I guess I'm potentially. I'm concerned about going back and then being like, Ob said they'll do it, but then, like, we may or may not do it. I might be, like, thinking about this the wrong way.  \nThem: I think we James still do it. The question, right? I mean, yeah. I agree that we James still do it. I think the question is. Yeah, we James still do it. The question is if. Like, if a pilot is the right way to go ahead, like, to open up citizen development to the rest of the world. Or do you think it's like it's more Sarah building out from Sarah and then getting it to a larger engagement?  \nMe: I didn't get. I think it's more building out from anyone getting it to larger engagement and. That's actually one of the things I wanted to get included in the criteria is at least doing, like, one workshop with either her executive team or like, some other people in the world, because they. She doesn't have a team yet, right? And. They do want to roll it out to the broader org, but they want to, like, see these use cases in place before that. And so I don't think even like during the pilot we would have a chance to do like a, like a broad based rollout to, like, lots of people. But we could reasonably do a workshop or two and getting maybe, like, five or 10 people to, like, have specific zaps built for them. If that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. Okay, so. I guess some decision times here. How do you feel about, like, positioning just the pilot straight up tomorrow or positioning up the whole plan?  \nMe: I like using the whole plan. So, like, I, I think I'm aligned with, hey, we should probably start effectively the same way I was going to start the other day of, like, hey, like, this is the value proposition of the, of the offer, therefore, like, this is, this is what the plan is. Before we talk about, like, pirates and, like, continue that stuff, like, we just, we need to FlowBuilder sure that if we have a plan that works and like, let's say at the end of this, three months, we could do, do all these things, like, is this, you know, in range? Yes. No, this doesn't FlowBuilder sense. All that kind of have that conversation. Assuming they say, yes, this is like, this is within. Within our budget. Like, if, like, assuming you can, like, deliver what you guys are talking about, this is within our budget, then it's like, okay, let's talk about how do we FlowBuilder. How do we FlowBuilder sure we're. Making a, like, strong decision in March, like, what are the specific things we have to measure? And then like that, then we talk about my rubric and the metrics that I have. And I'm sure there James be things they push back on that. But the goal is to walk out with immigrating to the overall value proposition and then they agree to the metrics. And then if they say yes, then I think it's like, okay, the pilot James only or I guess I, I. Think the pilot costs 20K or the pirate. We're just going to do the pilot for. For you. I guess it's the last.  \nThem: No, no. Pilot should. Should be. Should toss something.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay?  \nThem: Yeah. Pilot should always cost something. Here's the other thing that you could do, right, is we could say we do not have a pilot option. Like you could actually say we don't have a pilot option. The option that we have is that you sign an agreement with us. You can be on quarterly payments. And you have an opt out clause. If we don't hit one of these metrics or one of these requirements that you have. Right? Like, we don't have to just sit here like pilot and be like, okay, great. That sounds good. We could say. Okay, what's the concern here? Either way, where like there's going to be. A yeah. You could do two things right. You could either say, hey, We James do a pilot for three months. That's X amount, right? It's just a flat amount that we provide you. That might be at a premium of. That might be at a premium of. I could just voice this over tomorrow, too. Like, we don't have pricing, but let me just tell you how it goes one is you could either. Like, maybe we look at a pilot. We don't do pilots. But if we do apply it, that's going to be at a, like, much larger percentage of this, like, 80k number. So I just want you to prepare for it. Like, that number James actually, the total amount James probably go up. So what we usually look at is let's say a three months or 30 days, whatever it is. We don't just divide that number by 12 or divide that number by 9. We might divide that number. Your now plan might actually be 90k. And then we actually charge you 30k for the first you know, we charge you 30k for the first 30, you know, 90 days or whatever it might be. So that might be one of the, like, one of the things. The other option is we could sign a yearly agreement. And if we have very clear requirements, we could give you guys one of the things we can look at is an opt out clause to say, hey, if we don't hit one of these things, like there is an opt out clause. Like, that would have to mean, like, with the solutions architects, like, we are very clear on what we can do and can't do and, like, build that up. But maybe those are a couple other options that we have. There's a million ways we can take, take this. So, like, we want to figure out requirements. We want to figure out what you're about and then let's plan like and. But this is the plan. If we just went for an annual upfront price, right, with all the bells and whistles that you get and onboarding and all those solutions with pilots. We also don't like it because technically, you're just working on the workflows, and you're not really working on all the citizen development things that in a normal rollout, we actually do through CSMs and everything, because we know that, like, you want to roll it out across your company.  \nMe: So, so then just super tactful. Then we would. We would sort of basically end on the, hey, this is. Or the last slide. And this is the break or metrics you want to go on. And then basically then you would turn a voiceover. Like, if we do you a pilot, we don't typically do that. But if we, like harder do them, and it seems like these metrics FlowBuilder sense, this is kind of what the cost would potentially look like.  \nThem: Yeah, I think we price at 80k. And then if. Yeah, and then we just provide that. And then we first have to just see, like, what, like, funding is and budgetary funds are, and then just essentially, like, pare it down from there. And then it's. If it is pilot, like, you just switch very quickly. Over to, like, requirements. Right? And just like, okay, like, let's get really clear on requirements. I could even voice over, but. And that's where it's like, I actually don't know if we'll get to. I don't know if we'll actually get to finalizing this, especially if they have very strict requirements for next week. Right. But maybe that's something that we could also push. But it would just be the requirement part that are really important in my view, that.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: So I know it was very rambly, but I'm just thinking about it, and I was like, I just don't think pricing the pilot tomorrow. Is the right move. We need to talk about, like, hey, this is why we ask people not to do pilots, right? And then, like. And we should just ask like, okay, like, I heard that you've, you know, put a lot of spending into products and you just don't get the outcome.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: Totally hear you. Are you running into that issue with work auto right now? Like, I think is also the question, like, those are the questions that we should also be asking is, like, is the concern that, like, hey, you kind of have this Workado product that, like, continues saying, like, oh, this workflow can go live, that workflow can go live. And now you're worried you're going to pay for two systems that doesn't have like things going live. And I understand that concern. If, if, if that is. And either you can push the deal and say let's look at hi, we could either push the deal and say let's just get to that workflow and use case really quickly or we could either. Or we could either put the conversation to a. Or we could push the conversation to a pilot. And then just be like, these are the very strict requirements. But either way, I do think it's slipping, but we just need to, like, test it tomorrow, right? And we do have a chance to say, like, what do we have to do to get this through end of year, end of month? And then, like, would that discount that we talked about. Like you have that in the back pocket to use, too.  \nMe: No. I guess I wasn't even going to, like, raise the discount. In this context.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: That only made sense if they were, like, signing this month. I think even if they, like, duo pilot with us, I don't think they're, like, in the headspace of, like, oh, we're going to do a full year, like, opt out. The opt out value, I think, would still be too high. Does that FlowBuilder sense?  \nThem: Y. Eah y. Eah. Yeah. I think it's the right move. And then Jordan, I think. Yeah. So I think next step, like, I James join the call tomorrow. I think we have a plan of like, hey, this is our option because. Like the CFO or the CIO didn't tell us they wanted to pilot directly. Right? They only told Sarah, and Sarah gave us that info.  \nMe: Yes. That's correct.  \nThem: Yeah. So, so we could just be like, hey, we're just going to present with what we understand from before. I want to just go ahead and like. But I understand that there, there was conversations about a pilot. We still want to go through some of this just to understand, like, budgets, what, what costing looks like. Obviously, with a pilot that might be more.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: And then I think with Jordan, I would just figure out, like, confidence in their view of our product. I haven't looked at the thread, but maybe just stress testing Jordan for that combo. Would be what I'd like to look at.  \nMe: Y. Es. That makes sense. That. Those. I agree with that. Yeah. The last thing I'll say on Sample, we did talk after his call with Sarah yesterday when he sent the ping, and then we talked again after we sat in the chat with her this morning.  \nThem: Yeah. Y.  \nMe: And I think from his again. So we're playing telecom a little bit, but mindbreak. Understanding of how he felt that meeting went is kind of closer to your second scenario, where it's like, hey, we can build this out if we had the time. It's just, we don't.  \nThem: Eah. I lost you at. We could build that out, but.  \nMe: Yeah. We could vote that out, but it would just take some time for us to get up the learning curve. Not a this isn't doable type situation.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah, that would be. My push is, like, we already have the technical requirements to get it live, and, like, we can stress test Sarah right there in that conversation, too, which I don't like doing in that kind of space. But since I'm in it, I could just be like, hey, I just heard about, like, the. Lay of the land. Sarah, like, this is my understanding from Jordan, is that we actually meet all the technical requirements. To get the workflow up and running if we just had more time. And we've proven that through Jordan. We've proven that through our connections. Like, is that the case? And then we just kind of get a yes or no. And then. And then if she said no, like, you have to move over to a pilot, right?  \nMe: Yes. No, I think that's 100% valid.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I feel pretty strong and achieved. We'll say yes. And honestly, I can even like.  \nThem: Okay, cool. Yeah.  \nMe: I guess. Would you prefer I can prep her for that? I can also not if you would prefer. But I feel good that she would say yes about it.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I would say, and then be like, okay, in a. In a situation like this, Like, for. For $50-100K. Like, we could even say, like, for $50-100K. We're not going to. Like, we're not going to. Like, we could say, like, we're not. We don't really look at pilots for things like this. We might look at it for an AITP plan. So, like, again, just framing wise. Just changing it over to, like, when it's a $100K+ deal, we'll go ahead and do a pilot. We do a pilot where the Enterprise plan is essentially the pilot that you have. So people land at 55k or whatever it might be as a pilot, and then. Like, activate on aitp. So, like, I think where we're seeing and framing the value is, is not at like this 80k. Like, we're framing at 250. And that might be what they're doing with Work Auto too. Like, Workado might be a six. Like, much larger six figure deep. Like, it's probably like, high tens, low six figures.  \nMe: Yeah, that makes sense. Like, we might. We might be underpriced, what we're offering, potentially.  \nThem: Yeah, exactly. And honestly, they might not bulge, like, at 80k. They might just be like, oh, my work auto deal is extremely expensive because sometimes they are.  \nMe: Yeah. Yep, yep.  \nThem: So. So. Okay. I think we have a good plan. Yeah, I think. Prep Sarah. I think. Yeah, let's. If you do need to check with Jordan, but I think we're pretty good. I think we just go with the pricing, and then let's just. We'll just keep comms open, and then just. Go ahead and either switch over to, like, full or switch over to pilot.  \nMe: Yes. Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay.  \nThem: Thanks so much. Sorry about the whole DSR thing, because I was like, you're doing all that work. And I was like, it might really change after this combo. And that's why I'm, like, sequencing wise. I was like, just hop on the call, and then we figure it out from there.  \nMe: Yeah. Honestly, no. No worries at all. This is great. Everybody's. Seriously, I appreciate it. They always say the best metric of a sales manager's time is, would you spend money to get the advice? And every time I talk to you, I'm like, this deal is more likely to close and. Or the ARR goes up. So.  \nThem: Gosh, you should tell my kids that, because I don't. I don't think they want to pay me for my time, that's for sure. It's the opposite. But I appreciate. Alex, no, that's very kind, and, yeah, I appreciate it, but I got a hop, but I'll see you. Tomorrow morning.  \nMe: Talk to you all. Bye. All. Right. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/09941a7b-c025-43f6-b25c-ecbebcce8e99](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/09941a7b-c025-43f6-b25c-ecbebcce8e99)\n",

And it's more than just like, a prorated monthly rate, because it's like, there's the. Uncertainty involved. So when we do pilots, we have to, like, price it at a higher than whatever the prorated rate would be. Is kind of how I was thinking about bringing that."

Is this something that is within your budget for a product that works? Right? And it's like. Because the thing is, like, we're not even in. Like, we don't even go into a pilot discussion if they think it's going to be 15k. Right. Like, I think that's the other thing, like, you should consider is, like, we don't even get into a pilot conversation if they're like, nope, I can't even do, like, I thought this was going to be a 20k product. And then you're like, no. Totally off on value proposition, and, like, that's on us because, like, we're not proving enough ROI in your business. So that's why. That's why I feel that going into tomorrow with Pilot Price, Is going to set up, like, set up the conversation for yes. Let's like, oh, let's do a pilot, but then you're just going to go into commercials of that pilot. And. Like I almost feel like. Yeah."

Okay, like, how did the. Like, I didn't get a good sense just like you said on the build, and that's. Why I like having sellers in that call. That's why I even asked, like, if you were on it yesterday, is because then you get a sense of like, okay. They're like, oh, this is a small thing. Like, we can get to it. Like, you probably have a better read than even a say of, like, okay. They still feel like it's easy. They just need, like, more hours to just get this sorted, which is still good because you're like, hey, 12 hours of jam, like, in that time, like, obviously, we'll solve it. Like, you probably are proving this. Or it was like, oh, it feels really slow. It feels really. Challenging right now, and that's a totally different positioning of it. Because I'm hoping that it's the first. Right. Which is like, oh, yeah, like the architecture is there. We essentially can prove this. Generally, we usually don't do a pilot because there's like. And maybe the talk track I'm thinking about is we are a citizen development platform, too. I'm an AI orchestration layer. You don't really get, you know, hundreds of people on a platform or, like, multiple people on a platform. And be like, it's a pilot. Like, we need to actually figure this out right now. And maybe that is just. Let's just get to use case quicker. Like, you could even slow down the deal and say, well, what's the use case that we need to get? Like, we need to either prove that we can do or we can. We have to. Get close enough to get to signature, and I wonder if we can, like, get those out tomorrow."

She doesn't have a team yet, right? And. They do want to roll it out to the broader org, but they want to, like, see these use cases in place before that. And so I don't think even like during the pilot we would have a chance to do like a, like a broad based rollout to, like, lots of people. But we could reasonably do a workshop or two and getting maybe, like, five or 10 people to, like, have specific zaps built for them. If that makes sense."

Before we talk about, like, pirates and, like, continue that stuff, like, we just, we need to FlowBuilder sure that if we have a plan that works and like, let's say at the end of this, three months, we could do, do all these things, like, is this, you know, in range? Yes. No, this doesn't FlowBuilder sense. All that kind of have that conversation. Assuming they say, yes, this is like, this is within. Within our budget. Like, if, like, assuming you can, like, deliver what you guys are talking about, this is within our budget, then it's like, okay, let's talk about how do we FlowBuilder. How do we FlowBuilder sure we're. Making a, like, strong decision in March, like, what are the specific things we have to measure? And then like that, then we talk about my rubric and the metrics that I have. And I'm sure there James be things they push back on that. But the goal is to walk out with immigrating to the overall value proposition and then they agree to the metrics. And then if they say yes, then I think it's like, okay, the pilot James only or I guess I, I. Think the pilot costs 20K or the pirate. We're just going to do the pilot for. For you.

If we don't hit one of these metrics or one of these requirements that you have. Right? Like, we don't have to just sit here like pilot and be like, okay, great. That sounds good. We could say. Okay, what's the concern here? Either way, where like there's going to be. A yeah. You could do two things right. You could either say, hey, We James do a pilot for three months. That's X amount, right? It's just a flat amount that we provide you. That might be at a premium of. That might be at a premium of. I could just voice this over tomorrow, too. Like, we don't have pricing, but let me just tell you how it goes one is you could either. Like, maybe we look at a pilot. We don't do pilots. But if we do apply it, that's going to be at a, like, much larger percentage of this, like, 80k number. So I just want you to prepare for it. Like, that number James actually, the total amount James probably go up. So what we usually look at is let's say a three months or 30 days, whatever it is. We don't just divide that number by 12 or divide that number by 9. We might divide that number. Your now plan might actually be 90k. And then we actually charge you 30k for the first you know, we charge you 30k for the first 30, you know, 90 days or whatever it might be. So that might be one of the, like, one of the things. The other option is we could sign a yearly agreement. And if we have very clear requirements, we could give you guys one of the things we can look at is an opt out clause to say, hey, if we don't hit one of these things, like there is an opt out clause. Like, that would have to mean, like, with the solutions architects, like, we are very clear on what we can do and can't do and, like, build that up. But maybe those are a couple other options that we have. There's a million ways we can take, take this. So, like, we want to figure out requirements. We want to figure out what you're about and then let's plan like and. But this is the plan. If we just went for an annual upfront price, right, with all the bells and whistles that you get and onboarding and all those solutions with pilots. We also don't like it because technically, you're just working on the workflows, and you're not really working on all the citizen development things that in a normal rollout, we actually do through CSMs and everything, because we know that, like, you want to roll it out across your company."

And then basically then you would turn a voiceover. Like, if we do you a pilot, we don't typically do that. But if we, like harder do them, and it seems like these metrics FlowBuilder sense, this is kind of what the cost would potentially look like."

And then we first have to just see, like, what, like, funding is and budgetary funds are, and then just essentially, like, pare it down from there. And then it's. If it is pilot, like, you just switch very quickly. Over to, like, requirements. Right? And just like, okay, like, let's get really clear on requirements. I could even voice over, but. And that's where it's like, I actually don't know if we'll get to. I don't know if we'll actually get to finalizing this, especially if they have very strict requirements for next week. Right. But maybe that's something that we could also push. But it would just be the requirement part that are really important in my view, that."

We need to talk about, like, hey, this is why we ask people not to do pilots, right? And then, like. And we should just ask like, okay, like, I heard that you've, you know, put a lot of spending into products and you just don't get the outcome."

Like, I think is also the question, like, those are the questions that we should also be asking is, like, is the concern that, like, hey, you kind of have this Workado product that, like, continues saying, like, oh, this workflow can go live, that workflow can go live. And now you're worried you're going to pay for two systems that doesn't have like things going live. And I understand that concern. If, if, if that is. And either you can push the deal and say let's look at hi, we could either push the deal and say let's just get to that workflow and use case really quickly or we could either. Or we could either put the conversation to a. Or we could push the conversation to a pilot. And then just be like, these are the very strict requirements. But either way, I do think it's slipping, but we just need to, like, test it tomorrow, right? And we do have a chance to say, like, what do we have to do to get this through end of year, end of month? And then, like, would that discount that we talked about. Like you have that in the back pocket to use, too."

I think even if they, like, duo pilot with us, I don't think they're, like, in the headspace of, like, oh, we're going to do a full year, like, opt out. The opt out value, I think, would still be too high. Does that FlowBuilder sense?"

I think we have a plan of like, hey, this is our option because. Like the CFO or the CIO didn't tell us they wanted to pilot directly. Right? They only told Sarah, and Sarah gave us that info."

My push is, like, we already have the technical requirements to get it live, and, like, we can stress test Sarah right there in that conversation, too, which I don't like doing in that kind of space. But since I'm in it, I could just be like, hey, I just heard about, like, the. Lay of the land. Sarah, like, this is my understanding from Jordan, is that we actually meet all the technical requirements. To get the workflow up and running if we just had more time. And we've proven that through Jordan. We've proven that through our connections. Like, is that the case? And then we just kind of get a yes or no. And then. And then if she said no, like, you have to move over to a pilot, right?"

Like, we're not going to. Like, we could say, like, we're not. We don't really look at pilots for things like this. We might look at it for an AITP plan. So, like, again, just framing wise. Just changing it over to, like, when it's a $100K+ deal, we'll go ahead and do a pilot. We do a pilot where the Enterprise plan is essentially the pilot that you have. So people land at 55k or whatever it might be as a pilot, and then. Like, activate on aitp. So, like, I think where we're seeing and framing the value is, is not at like this 80k. Like, we're framing at 250. And that might be what they're doing with Work Auto too. Like, Workado might be a six. Like, much larger six figure deep. Like, it's probably like, high tens, low six figures."

          "text": "Yeah, exactly. And honestly, they might not bulge, like, at 80k. They might just be like, oh, my work auto deal is extremely expensive because sometimes they are."

And the fact that they were just building it with Riccato in the background, that is a little frustrating because we could have just been, I don't know. Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah, and they have a full in house contractor just building on ricotta it sounds like. So that's hard to compete with also.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: But, yeah, long term, I think focusing on the long term goal. From my perspective.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You want Citizen Development, it's not going to be through a cop, it's going to be due AutomateFlow.  \nMe: Yes. I'm just trying. Like, how do we FlowBuilder that? Because, like, I want to. I basically want to frame it as, like, oh, the enterprise stuff is check the box. Like, yes, we do need data. We have the security requirements. We. The bring your own model stuff that you guys said was really important. We have all those things. We'll both have have all those things. What we James not both have is the ability to get. Every God. Damn. Get every. Sorry. My cats are knocking over their food. Tower thing to get every person at the company up to speed and, like, brought along. I think if we can do, like, one of those workshops, it'll FlowBuilder a big difference.  \nThem: And thinking about. I think you already hear. But what's the metric? What's the thing that James help us measure that between the two systems?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Because the less fuzzy we can FlowBuilder it, the better, where it's not just kind of opinions.  \nMe: Y. Eah, I like, I think if it's like, honestly, if we can even go as far as like, is it literally just like number of automations built by people on the team or something? Could be a good like, type of metric for us to measure.  \nThem: Yeah. Throughout the calls and the whole quarter I think of Secret Mission in the back of my head would be like trying to get Sarah to build some of these 1 personal productivity ones in AutomateFlow for herself too. Just like, hey, you should go. Because if she builds a few of those and realizes, like, oh, this is super easy.  \nMe: Yeah. And then she also mentioned, which is like, I think we 100% would do, but, like, it's just like the. I think for helping her build confidence, one of the. For getting the first step is just like, hey, let's connect to all the systems. Like, let's get the connections up and running. Let's FlowBuilder sure the test the apps like, can we connect or do we have the Outlook permissions that we need?  \nThem: Anyway.  \nMe: Like, get that all, like, really tight, which I think James help her feel confident, too, as, like, getting started, but okay. I think. I think it's. Transparently. I think in practice, your next couple months probably look the same as they were going to otherwise.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: But now it's just a matter of. Okay, we need to. At the end of that. Come to an agreement. I'm also, like. The other thing I'm thinking about is, like, do we just pitch, like, a broader aitp? Because, like. Because the whole premise of this original offer was like, hey, Sarah, I know you said you're doing a broader transformation, but, like, we just need to get you these. Things built. So, like, let's get you these things built. But like, if we're, if we're doing a two month evaluation, like. At the end of the two months, do we want to say, like, we're going to actually help you transform your. And I think that maybe is like, a world in which Mercado just can't win. But I don't know.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I don't know if that's too much of a. Like, that's too much of a leap from what we've been, like, talking about so far, though.  \nThem: Yeah. My inexperience gut is says like that. Because that's what, like A hundred over 100k for that? At least for the AI transformation project.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: It seems like something that would be like, okay, at the end of this evaluation in this pilot, then we could pitch that and say, like, you decided to go all in with AutomateFlow. And we're going to try to execute it faster on that long term vision of citizen development. So this is the right path for you versus trying to.  \nMe: Y. Eah. That's a good point. Yeah.  \nThem: Swap out of.  \nMe: And also, like, I feel like we can, we can, like, avoid commercials anyway because, like, it's like, all we're really talking about is, like, what, what James we charge for, like, to do this stuff for you for these couple of months? That is not saying what James a long term contract look like? And if that long term contract, explicitly builds in more trainings, builds in, like, some of that broader system development that we were explicitly not pulling into the prior one because it was just focused on helping Sarah build then I think there's, like, real justification for, like, a difference in price at the end. At the end of it. But we can have that conversation. Then. Once they sort of, like, decided. If they've decided that AutomateFlow is the right partner, then I think that's a much better position for us to be in from, like a negotiating conversation. But we have to get there. We'll see. All right. Thanks, tim. I mean, it seems like. At least it seems like we'll get some revenue this month. Silver linings.  \nThem: Yeah, small steps. Small steps.  \nMe: All right, talk to you later.  \nThem: How do you see? \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/...

The other thing I'm thinking about is, like, do we just pitch, like, a broader aitp? Because, like. Because the whole premise of this original offer was like, hey, Sarah, I know you said you're doing a broader transformation, but, like, we just need to get you these. Things built. So, like, let's get you these things built. But like, if we're, if we're doing a two month evaluation, like. At the end of the two months, do we want to say, like, we're going to actually help you transform your. And I think that maybe is like, a world in which Mercado just can't win. But I don't know."

That is not saying what James a long term contract look like? And if that long term contract, explicitly builds in more trainings, builds in, like, some of that broader system development that we were explicitly not pulling into the prior one because it was just focused on helping Sarah build then I think there's, like, real justification for, like, a difference in price at the end. At the end of it. But we can have that conversation. Then. Once they sort of, like, decided. If they've decided that AutomateFlow is the right partner, then I think that's a much better position for us to be in from, like a negotiating conversation. But we have to get there. We'll see. All right. Thanks, tim. I mean, it seems like. At least it seems like we'll get some revenue this month. Silver linings."

Good morning.  \nThem: Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Here I am.  \nMe: Also happy to have you join, but also feel free to drop if you have other stuff you want to, because I think we're not going to at all be talking technical stuff yet. More so like evaluation criteria. Happy to have you on give input on that, but also happy to give the time back. If you don't want to join.  \nThem: Yeah. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I definitely listen in. I think it's always good for me to learn.  \nMe: Cool.  \nThem: Can you hear the rain?  \nMe: No, I cannot. Is it pretty bad? The storm started.  \nThem: It's not bad. It's just I'm shed with a tin roof, and so if it does get bad, I probably have to switch to bows or something.  \nMe: Oh, no. Yeah, it's pretty. The voice. The noise canceling is pretty good. I don't hear it at all.  \nThem: Good, good. Good.  \nMe: It's kind of wild. I don't know, that kind of thing. I feel like even five, ten years ago was really hard and we all expected, and it's not even. I don't know, it just happened to the background.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah, it's. Crazy. New norms. I was just talking to my buddy this morning. He runs a dock company. Like, they build docs on lakes. He's talking about sales, and he's like, oh, that's crazy. You guys just. He's like, do you do it over, like, Skype or something? And I'm like, zoom. But. Yeah. Yeah. We've never seen anybody in person. Almost never. That's crazy.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: So it's funny.  \nMe: I mean, it's probably a bit different when you're building physical things.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Hey. Good morning.  \nMe: Sarah. Good morning. How are you doing?  \nThem: Doing all right. We're having, like, weird weather in Boston. It's like, 15 degrees, and then it's like.  \nMe: Oh, my God. Are you guys. You're probably not affected by that big snowstorm coming this weekend, right? Because that's probably farther south.  \nThem: I think we. We're supposed to be. To some extent, we'll see whether it actually materializes.  \nMe: Okay. Well, I guess. I mean, it's also. It's always doing in Boston, and so it's like, that's not even.  \nThem: Miserable.  \nMe: I don't think we'll need the full hour for this. Could you maybe just, like, Sar, could you just, like, walk me a bit through, like, hey, how did the conversation with Robert go? Like, what was the like, what was the feedback? How are they thinking about the evaluation? And honestly, like, full transparency when I'M a little afraid of is like a world where we invest a lot in an evaluation, but there's always going to be workado because, like, oh, they have a. You have a solution already. And so the switching cost is just too much effort to like, go through. And so when I was sort of understand, like, hey. Like, what are the criteria that, like, might or could actually move the needle? Or is it just, like, they just don't want to switch, and that's kind of where we are, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yeah. No, I, I don't. I think Robert's mindset is very much like. And you kind of heard some of this on the call. Like, sometimes that that team and this, the workout of decision happened before I came on, tended to rush into decisions and contracts. And so I don't think he's of the mind that, like, just because we already started building, like that sunk cost, right? That sun cost fallacy. I think he's more concerned with making the right decision from a long term perspective. And he was like, well, do we feel like, you know, we can confidently FlowBuilder a recommendation at this point that either we're caught at or AutomateFlow is the right, like, long term solution, that if we then open this up, to all of our employees and citizen developers in Q3 that, you know, this is going to be the easiest to use platform. And I was like, well, you know, I can tell, like, this is what I heard in the demo. And here's the compare and contrast. But like, you don't really know until you get in there and build. And so I think that's the purpose of it is.  \nMe: There we have. Yeah.  \nThem: Actually do more of, like, I think the things that James really move the needle are, like, how usable, like, is it actually if we start to get multiple people on the IT team using IT and building their own zaps. Which is why I spent some time with Jordan yesterday, trying to, like, maybe troubleshoot some of what Robert was doing because he was like, oh, I, like, tried to build the same zap that Jordan was demoing after the call, and I ran into some issues.  \nMe: Yeah. That's a common.  \nThem: Yeah. He was like, I set it up. And like, it. It told me that I have lunch every day. And it kept asking me, like, who are you going to have lunch with today? I'm like, I'm sure there's something that, you know, is wrong in the way that he's setting it up.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I think it's kind of.  \nMe: And the whole point is, like, we want to. We can help him, you know, like, have that conversation, have our Robert on a call, have Jordan with him on a call as he's doing that, like, that type of stuff.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. So I think, like, the usability and actually, like, showing people like Robert on our team that, like, this is going to be easy because I think he's actually, like, compared to some of the other executives I've seen more technically savvy. Like, I've been on calls where they're like, okay, well, like, I don't know how to find my, like, teams meeting transcripts. I'm like, oh, my God. Okay, like, let's walk you through it step by step. And this is, like, the COO of some function, right? So, yeah, there's going to be, like, a wide range, so I think, like, bringing people along on the feasibility and then having confidence that, like, the, the, like the connections and the invoice assistant that we build, like, actually works and works well.  \nMe: Yeah. Y. Eah.  \nThem: I think is going to be like the biggest proof point. And I think also hopefully that gives us some data points to say, like here was the comparison with like how easy or how difficult it was to set that up in Workado vs AutomateFlow. I think the other thing is because they are charging no cost for year one of. Of development. Like, it's kind of like, well, why wouldn't we?  \nMe: Y. Eah. Well, yeah, and I guess, do you have any information on, like, how is that Workado contract structured? And in particular, like, I guess what we often see when we, when we're like sort of heads up against Workado is they, they basically charge you per automation. Right? So they're like, we'll build them. For free, but your cost scales with each new one. Versus that's like, not the model with us. I'm curious how they have. Are they, like, talking about adjusting that or, like. Or anything?  \nThem: Correct. No. So the contract right now. Is primarily paying for. I think it's called work Auto Go as a product. So it's the like, orchestration. We're primarily using it to FlowBuilder sure that data syncs up between core enterprise applications. And then in the contract, it says, like, for year one, if you want to build genies, We'll do that for free. But it's not like I know Fang was picking in the demo on like having Jordan hours and the increments for scaling up on that TAM support. I mean, they're not explicit about it. I actually am not impressed at all with their customer support. So I think it's a little bit of, like, they say they include the, you know, hands on, like, build assistance for free, but when you actually put it down on paper, it's going to be far less than six or 12 hours. And, like, there's a quality reference there too.  \nMe: And I guess maybe another clarifying question. So is, is are you just having to build this twice this this quarter is effectively what's happening like? Or is it like. Yeah, could you talk to me a bit about.  \nThem: A bit. Yeah. So I think. I think the thought is, like, we're not, you know, we understand that there's going to be some, like, rebuild required with this solution, but that it's better to do that in, like, a very constrained, Q1, low cost kind of way than it is to, like, move forward. With, you know, one particular platform and they realize it's not the right decision and then have to scale back like a whole bunch of citizen development. So I think the thought is on the software license optimization side also. The other thing I found out over the course of the past week is that Jordan had some contractors already start building the software licensing agent in Workado. And I did not know that. So there's more, even more sunk cost on like, oh, but like, they already started building. And he said to me, he was like, I'm not tied to any one platform. I'm like, you clearly are. And now I'm having to kind of, like, work around that. But at the end of the day, like, Robert is the decision maker. I am the decision maker on the agent platform. He is not. But I would like to FlowBuilder sure we're not, like, wasting resources.  \nMe: For sure. Yeah. And I guess, I mean, honestly, full transparency, like, if. If the alternative is, like, they're. If they have people on the workado side building it for you, like, we can do that, too, right? Like, that's. That's an option that we have with our. With the. With the way our.  \nThem: They're not. They're not really like they say they are, providing that build support, but it's not. I think it's. It's primarily the one contractor on our team that's been building it, and then I guess he's been asking them for advice or something. I don't. Know what the working model has been, but I don't play that involved.  \nMe: Totally. Okay, if you don't know yet, like, how far along are they on that build process? Do you know? Like, are they, like. Is it, like, connected and working? Are they just, like. Just started?  \nThem: I asked them for a call later today. So that's my one hour after this is to kind of dig into that and understand a little bit more of, like, where they're at.  \nMe: Okay? Okay?  \nThem: So, like, I. I think given what's happened, the license optimization genie that they started building in Mercado, I'm like, okay, fine. Like, let's just do that then and figure out how that works. And I want to be, like, more involved in the process and be learning and try to also, like, then. I would, like, take those learnings and build out the. Try to build out the invoice assistant myself and see, like, how far that goes. I think on the AutomateFlow side, if we focus on the invoice assistant build, you know, we can kind of have learnings in a more use case driven way. That's like. And, you know, I don't want to. I don't think it feels right to me to, like, engage you guys without any, like, to just kind of give you the run around. Right. So I do want to FlowBuilder sure, like, we find something contract wise that, you know, makes sense for Q1. And we can FlowBuilder that build support and usage and structure that in a way that feels right for both groups.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I think. I think that's right. Okay, this is all super helpful. So what I'm. Let me play back sort of what I'm thinking for tomorrow conversation and see if you're aligned. So there's one piece of. Hey, this is what it would cost to do a month, I think I don't. Have a specific number there, but I'm thinking basically, like, a quarter of what the entire amount was, give or take, as a starting point. And we can. We can work with you guys around, like, what. What that right amount is, but I honestly think what's more important. Is getting really sharp on. These are the criteria we're going to use.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: To, like, judge an evaluation. And sort of this is like the process because what you've laid out, admittedly a little biased, but I do think AutomateFlow is gonna would be better positioned, particularly if citizen development is a thing that like, you guys care about, if ease of use and build is a thing that you guys care about, and then also, I want to find some way to bake in. Like, we'll do multiple of these because I think that's also, like, a key differentiator for us. Right? Because, like, you know, when it's all centralized, workout of work, still build those genies for you. But when, when we get to a world, even if it's a year from now where you have citizen development, I don't think workado, like, has the capability. Like, I mean, again, like, I'm sure they'll frame some capability to do it, but, like, I don't think they have the world in which every person know Horizon Ventures companies. Is able to use AutomateFlow, like, or use, use Workado to like, build their own personal agents and all that stuff. So I would, I think having the, the one we talked about, like, I think I post texting you this morning. I think I would love to include even a second or even third, like, or maybe I don't know if this is, like, too much, but, like, just give us the, like, list and see who can go through, like, more of them in the three months type thing, because I think that is where we're potentially official. The other thing is, I would love to do and again, like, we can FlowBuilder this like a criteria for both. Even just an hour workshop with the exec, with the executive team, where it's like, hey, like, let's get you building a zap. Building a. Building an agent in some 30 minute. Like, actually, no, like an hour period. And we do those kind of workshops, like, all the time and. So that James help, like, click. Okay, this is how this makes sense. All any of the bugs that they're running into as they're building. Like, we help them work through that in real time, and then that, I think, often lowers the barrier going forward.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nMe: I think so, yeah. Those, those two, I think major adjustments, like, to the, like, criteria, I think would help us, like, FlowBuilder the case of, like, why AutomateFlow could FlowBuilder sense. And then I guess the only other thing for me would be, like, how do we turn the cut off frame? Like, basically, like, how do we get. To the end and not be, like, I'm still not quite sure. Even if, like, there's a rubric. I don't know if that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, I don't think that. Yeah, I know. I think there's two, like, scenarios to mitigate for. One is that for sure? The other one is, like, I wouldn't want to, you know, kind of sign up for a year, and at the end of it, we're like, oh, actually. Like there's not a long term thing. So I think like getting the buy in to and having a little bit more time to build like confidence across the rest of the team, they're like, oh, I'm super excited for this. Like, I want to be a champion for it within it. And like, honestly, I I'm a little, like, fed up with just dealing with the whole, like, workado. They've, like, really just. They. They do basically dove off the deep end without Robert and I knowing, which feels wrong to me. And I'm like, okay, I don't. It's getting political, like, to just, like, right? The ship and have some structure to how we're going to do that. Because I don't think that, like, getting thing on another call and us like, working through it.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: I mean, it might end up. It might result in, like, us sending a contract, but it's not going to FlowBuilder my life easy.  \nMe: Easier. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.  \nThem: In the long run. So I'd rather have there be, like, enough. Enough, like, proof points for us to be like, okay, like, let's put this to bed once in a and for all. Because it's not just, like, him that's kind of going off and doing this. Like, he's bringing multiple. People on his team along and like having them spend time on it. So, yeah.  \nMe: That makes sense. So it sounds like the people, like, obviously, like, you need to approve the criteria. Robert it sounds like getting frantically, like, I agree in these criteria. Even if he, like, that would be important, right? For him to say, like, these. These, like, yes. These are, like, things that we're looking for in a system. Whether that's. You guys or Mercado, theoretically. And then.  \nThem: Y. Eah.  \nMe: Laying out, like, okay, here are the, like, it basically, like, here's, like, how we're making the decision, how we're actually going to FlowBuilder the decision, or, like, what the, like, thresholds that we need to see to, like, FlowBuilder that decision.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Be honest with, like, we can sidebar on this if, like, the approach makes zero sense and you're just like, Sarah seems super confused and maybe, like, she needs some advice on how to handle this better. I just.  \nMe: I don't think your approach is confused. I mean, full transparency. I was a little surprised up to now that we workado hadn't done anything like this. And so this is like, you know, it happens in competitive situations. I think. I think the approach you're laying out is right. And really, I think it's just like, hey, how do we FlowBuilder sure that the criteria are set up, like, appropriately like that we're measuring the real things? Again. Sorry. I realize I'm, like, really biased. Like, obviously, I'm a salesperson, so, like, I want us to win, but, like, we want the criteria to be, like, what you just described are things that I think we can do in Riccato. Camp, right?  \nThem: I think there are, like, targeted people on the team at the leadership level. Like, Fang's boss came to me the other day and was like, I have 2,000 unread emails. I, like, really want something that helps me categorize them. Can you show me how to. So, like, you know, I showed him how. To set it up and like chat GPT. But I'm like, we should get you in a platform that can help you do this in an automated way so you're not having to that prompt every time. So I think they're like targeted kind of sessions we could do with people on the team to kind of bring, like, build.  \nMe: Yeah. Honestly, if that. Because I feel like. Didn't Robert also, like, I feel like what he mentioned was, like, a similar type of workflow where he was like, I was trying to summarize my emails or look at meetings or something like that. That's something like, hey, we can do, like, an executive productivity session, right? Like, maybe. Invite. Like, I don't know how many it would be. Maybe it's like, 5 to 10 of your C suite and, like, the level below and, like, hey, in an hour, we'll get you some agents that can, like, summarize your inboxes for you and, like, help you prep for meetings without. Like, having to do a lot of work, and that's like, the kind of thing we can. I would. I think we can build that into, like, at least one workshop, like, during this three month period, because that's going to be important once we get to the citizen development piece, even if we're not like. Doing that yet.  \nThem: Yeah. And I think, like, maybe we can work on what does it look like to kind of troubleshoot some of the potential kinks in our environment before that? Because I think where you, like, you lose. You lose people very quickly if they're like, oh, and then I have to do this. Microsoft permissions and wait. Like, two days for the security team to approve it, and then we've. We've lost them. So I think just, yeah, if we can work out, like. And Jordan and I started, like, building this yesterday, just, like, what's the right way to frame it also, so that just doesn't feel as, like, overwhelming. Like I told him, like, Jordan, I know you know exactly whether to choose, like, a web hook or, you know, AI stuff or, like, all these things.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: For Robert building it. He's like, I have no idea what should be an outlook step or an AI step or, you know.  \nMe: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.  \nThem: Yeah. Alex touched on those workshops that we've done over and over again. And that's always, like, the first part of it. It's like, here's, you know, here's. Here's how you think about it in your head. And then also here's how you might even think about a framework for what should you even do? Like, what should you automate? Right. Things that are repeatable, annoying, or predictable. And hand those tools, too. And it's. It's really helpful. Totally. So, Alex, I don't know. Like, what? What do you think? Or maybe you need to go back to the team and chat a little bit more about, like, what do you think pricing or a structure could look like for us?  \nMe: I mean, I need to get, like, specifics, but I. If. If it's reasonable for you, I'm thinking just like a quarter of the amounts. Like 20k for the 3 months is kind of what I'm thinking about right now. If that's, like, right range.  \nThem: Okay? Yeah, and that would. And so that would still include the, like, TAM hours. It would be, like, structured as TAM hours and credit usage, essentially.  \nMe: Yeah. And again, I need to confirm because we don't. Pilots are like a little different, like, structurally. But it would, it would effectively be a three month version of the year contract that we were looking at is kind of what I'm thinking about.  \nThem: Okay? And.  \nMe: Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Like, come. Come back to me and confirm. The one thing I want to FlowBuilder sure I understand in that is for the credit usage piece, because I don't know, like, once we build these, how many we're going to actually use, but I imagine it's going to be a lot lower volume. Wise than what you and I actually discussed. So James that be, like. James the contract be split out into, like, here's the TAM time portion and then here's the credit portion, like, up to this amount, but incurred based on usage.  \nMe: Yeah. For sure. So full transparency. What we would probably want to do is just say, like, hey, basically you were the plan would be you have the same 600k credits for the year and like during the pilot James like consume however many we use them. If we transition to a full enterprise agreement, we'll just have those James be like the credits that were used in the. In the. In those two months, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Okay? So it would be like the full year is represented as a cap.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And then. Okay, it's. It's just the consumable portion towards that.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Okay? Sounds good. And I think, like, I'm happy to put forward the MSA with the legal team to. Based on my conversation with Robert yesterday, I think he feels comfortable with us moving ahead with the court. I mean, obviously, he'll still need to kind of look at the contract, but I don't know if he accepted. The meeting tomorrow is what I.  \nMe: Yeah. I think he did. Yeah, because he actually did the suggestion to move in 30 minutes earlier.  \nThem: Oh, okay, great. All right. Sounds good. Yeah, we can. That's awesome.  \nMe: Okay, now this is. This is helpful. So next steps, I'm going to go talk to our, like, internal, like, deal pricing team and be like, hey, can we put this offer together? Then I am going to basically put together, like, this is what I think the evaluation should include based off of, like, what I've heard from Sarah from our last conversation. These are the things that are important. Want to FlowBuilder sure aligned. Okay, if so, these are the boxes we're trying to check over the next three. Months. If yes. Okay. This is how much it would cost to, like for us to do that.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: Is kind of how I'm thinking about it. I'll. I'll pull that together, share with you, but I think. I think we're on the same page in terms of, like, what criteria to add. It's like multiple builds, team in team development, ease of use. Right. It's kind of like.  \nThem: I wouldn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And include, like, Price Security.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay, that does FlowBuilder sense. Like, sort of like the. In my head, like the. Yeah, like the basic security components of the system. Yeah. We need to pull all that stuff in. That makes sense. Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. One of the contractors on their team. I think he might just be misinformed, but I started pinging him yesterday to understand where he. Where he was at, and I asked him, like, have you had experience working in AutomateFlow instead of Workado before? And he said,  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: There's a difference in security and compliance features around data residency options, retention time, data masking options, and external log streaming. That has traditionally been where I've seen work how to differentiates. But it's been a minute since I compared those to what AutomateFlow provides, and I was kind of like, wouldn't those things just be covered in the msa, like.  \nMe: Yeah. So, I mean, so to be fair, AutomateFlow, like, if he's probably, if he use AutomateFlow even three, four years ago, he. That probably were, like, things that we as a company were not thinking about at the time, but we've done, like, a lot of work over the last several years to build like basic. What we. I would consider those, like, what I would call basic enterprise features. Right. If you're selling to any large company, like, you need data, residency requirements, you need to be specific about where things are being housed, all that kind of stuff. So understand why he would think that. But we have a we've? Done work on it.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Okay? Cool.  \nMe: Yeah. So. Yeah, like that. That. Okay, that does FlowBuilder sense. Okay, cool.  \nThem: Awesome. And then I have time with the AP team tomorrow, so come early next week. I should have a lot more detail on, like, the exact process flow that they want built out, and then we can start working on.  \nMe: Sounds good. And then actually, I guess one maybe like, other tactical question. Are they giving you, like, what is their support model going to look like here? Like, super tactically? Because, like, with us, like, you'll obviously, you'll have. You'll have Jordan, you'll have Robert, we'll have the channel. We'll do some of these workshops, like have they said, or they just kind of like, oh, well, we'll do something because you know what I mean?  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. From what I've seen, I think they operate. I mean, they had. They have a channel. It's not really used by our team. Like, I looked at the history and there's like, not in there. So it seems like they just operate based on calls primarily. Like, if we're like, hey, James you hop? On a call. They'll be open to that. And then it's primarily the contractor on Fang's team that I think would be like the build person. And we are, you know, paying for him as a full time contractor, but he's not. He's working on, like, a whole bunch of different things.  \nMe: Anything. Got you. Yeah. And so I guess, maybe is that also potentially part of it? It's like workado. Because, like, with. With us, we're always sort of in a bit of a weird middle ground. If I'm hearing you, I think it actually would be better, at least for these initial use cases, for us to just build them, rather than, like, having you guys sort of learn to build them and then separately, like, help you learn. Get up the curve on, like, how AutomateFlow is easy to use otherwise, is that the right way to think about it, or do you think it'd still be, like, better to, like, have, like, you build it with. With our support, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, either way, I would like to FlowBuilder sure I learn, like, the right way to do things. I think, in both platforms because I think at the end of the day, like, I need to be able to confident, like here that, you know, here are the bright spots and the gaps I saw in both platforms.  \nMe: Yeah. O. Kay.  \nThem: I think, you know. You know, you tell me, like, what. What is the faster path going to be? Because I also, I'm like, okay, now I've committed to coming back, like, March, you know, 31st, the exact team to be like, here are the pilot results, and here's what we found, and here's the ROI implications moving forward. So, yeah, I don't. I don't know what you think James be more efficient.  \nMe: Y. Eah. I guess. Maybe. Maybe what we. Maybe what it is, is, like, we still do the one together. And I'm just. What I'm trying. And part of what I'm trying to be thoughtful about, too, is just, like, I realized doing both of these is just going to be so much time for you. So, like. Maybe we do, like, one together. And, like, the one that you and Jordan had started on, once you have, like, the actual, like, login information, we can, like, get that set up in, like, a real way. And then separately, we work to build maybe that invoice flow or something, or, like, if there's another one. That the team wants to, like, prioritize because of, like, the level of complexity or something. And, like, we just built that one. And so, like, the. So it's like, hey, this is how easy for you to do. And this is what it's like when we just, like, James help you, like, build something.  \nThem: Okay. Yeah, that would be great. I think maybe, like, Jordan, then if you and I can work on the invoice assistant use case, and then if the team can build out the software license one. So, I mean, I actually, I think that's a great idea because then we could say, like. And look at all the. Contractor time and spend that we had on workado, because their support model was primarily have our contractor build it and then have them kind of just advise when. When he needs to, and then, like, there's a chance that they might not really be able to finish on. On time or on budget, so.  \nMe: Y. Eah. Exactly. I mean. I. I hope that, like, it's always bad to say, I hope they don't finish on time, but, like, I. I think that's, like a. A real risk.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: We structure it right, Okay? Cool. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/dc12cc98-1f30-4623-9695-2a5fc1a83d0d](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/dc12cc98-1f30-4623-9695-2a5fc1a83d0d)\n",

And honestly, like, full transparency when I'M a little afraid of is like a world where we invest a lot in an evaluation, but there's always going to be workado because, like, oh, they have a. You have a solution already. And so the switching cost is just too much effort to like, go through. And so when I was sort of understand, like, hey. Like, what are the criteria that, like, might or could actually move the needle? Or is it just, like, they just don't want to switch, and that's kind of where we are, if that makes sense."

And so I don't think he's of the mind that, like, just because we already started building, like that sunk cost, right? That sun cost fallacy. I think he's more concerned with making the right decision from a long term perspective. And he was like, well, do we feel like, you know, we can confidently FlowBuilder a recommendation at this point that either we're caught at or AutomateFlow is the right, like, long term solution, that if we then open this up, to all of our employees and citizen developers in Q3 that, you know, this is going to be the easiest to use platform. And I was like, well, you know, I can tell, like, this is what I heard in the demo. And here's the compare and contrast. But like, you don't really know until you get in there and build.

So, yeah, there's going to be, like, a wide range, so I think, like, bringing people along on the feasibility and then having confidence that, like, the, the, like the connections and the invoice assistant that we build, like, actually works and works well."

And I think also hopefully that gives us some data points to say, like here was the comparison with like how easy or how difficult it was to set that up in Workado vs AutomateFlow. I think the other thing is because they are charging no cost for year one of. Of development. Like, it's kind of like, well, why wouldn't we?"
        },

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Y. Eah. Well, yeah, and I guess, do you have any information on, like, how is that Workado contract structured? And in particular, like, I guess what we often see when we, when we're like sort of heads up against Workado is they, they basically charge you per automation. Right? So they're like, we'll build them. For free, but your cost scales with each new one. Versus that's like, not the model with us. I'm curious how they have. Are they, like, talking about adjusting that or, like. Or anything?"

        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Correct. No. So the contract right now. Is primarily paying for. I think it's called work Auto Go as a product. So it's the like, orchestration. We're primarily using it to FlowBuilder sure that data syncs up between core enterprise applications. And then in the contract, it says, like, for year one, if you want to build genies, We'll do that for free. But it's not like I know Fang was picking in the demo on like having Jordan hours and the increments for scaling up on that TAM support. I mean, they're not explicit about it. I actually am not impressed at all with their customer support. So I think it's a little bit of, like, they say they include the, you know, hands on, like, build assistance for free, but when you actually put it down on paper, it's going to be far less than six or 12 hours. And, like, there's a quality reference there too."

          "speaker": "me",

        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "A bit. Yeah. So I think. I think the thought is, like, we're not, you know, we understand that there's going to be some, like, rebuild required with this solution, but that it's better to do that in, like, a very constrained, Q1, low cost kind of way than it is to, like, move forward. With, you know, one particular platform and they realize it's not the right decision and then have to scale back like a whole bunch of citizen development. So I think the thought is on the software license optimization side also. The other thing I found out over the course of the past week is that Jordan had some contractors already start building the software licensing agent in Workado. And I did not know that. So there's more, even more sunk cost on like, oh, but like, they already started building. And he said to me, he was like, I'm not tied to any one platform. I'm like, you clearly are. And now I'm having to kind of, like, work around that. But at the end of the day, like, Robert is the decision maker. I am the decision maker on the agent platform. He is not. But I would like to FlowBuilder sure we're not, like, wasting resources."

Like, let's just do that then and figure out how that works. And I want to be, like, more involved in the process and be learning and try to also, like, then. I would, like, take those learnings and build out the. Try to build out the invoice assistant myself and see, like, how far that goes. I think on the AutomateFlow side, if we focus on the invoice assistant build, you know, we can kind of have learnings in a more use case driven way. That's like. And, you know, I don't want to. I don't think it feels right to me to, like, engage you guys without any, like, to just kind of give you the run around. Right. So I do want to FlowBuilder sure, like, we find something contract wise that, you know, makes sense for Q1. And we can FlowBuilder that build support and usage and structure that in a way that feels right for both groups."

Let me play back sort of what I'm thinking for tomorrow conversation and see if you're aligned. So there's one piece of. Hey, this is what it would cost to do a month, I think I don't. Have a specific number there, but I'm thinking basically, like, a quarter of what the entire amount was, give or take, as a starting point. And we can. We can work with you guys around, like, what. What that right amount is, but I honestly think what's more important. Is getting really sharp on. These are the criteria we're going to use."

And sort of this is like the process because what you've laid out, admittedly a little biased, but I do think AutomateFlow is gonna would be better positioned, particularly if citizen development is a thing that like, you guys care about, if ease of use and build is a thing that you guys care about, and then also, I want to find some way to bake in. Like, we'll do multiple of these because I think that's also, like, a key differentiator for us. Right? Because, like, you know, when it's all centralized, workout of work, still build those genies for you. But when, when we get to a world, even if it's a year from now where you have citizen development, I don't think workado, like, has the capability. Like, I mean, again, like, I'm sure they'll frame some capability to do it, but, like, I don't think they have the world in which every person know Horizon Ventures companies. Is able to use AutomateFlow, like, or use, use Workado to like, build their own personal agents and all that stuff. So I would, I think having the, the one we talked about, like, I think I post texting you this morning. I think I would love to include even a second or even third, like, or maybe I don't know if this is, like, too much, but, like, just give us the, like, list and see who can go through, like, more of them in the three months type thing, because I think that is where we're potentially official. The other thing is, I would love to do and again, like, we can FlowBuilder this like a criteria for both. Even just an hour workshop with the exec, with the executive team, where it's like, hey, like, let's get you building a zap. Building a. Building an agent in some 30 minute. Like, actually, no, like an hour period. And we do those kind of workshops, like, all the time and. So that James help, like, click. Okay, this is how this makes sense. All any of the bugs that they're running into as they're building. Like, we help them work through that in real time, and then that, I think, often lowers the barrier going forward."

So I think like getting the buy in to and having a little bit more time to build like confidence across the rest of the team, they're like, oh, I'm super excited for this. Like, I want to be a champion for it within it. And like, honestly, I I'm a little, like, fed up with just dealing with the whole, like, workado. They've, like, really just. They. They do basically dove off the deep end without Robert and I knowing, which feels wrong to me. And I'm like, okay, I don't. It's getting political, like, to just, like, right?

If I'm hearing you, I think it actually would be better, at least for these initial use cases, for us to just build them, rather than, like, having you guys sort of learn to build them and then separately, like, help you learn. Get up the curve on, like, how AutomateFlow is easy to use otherwise, is that the right way to think about it, or do you think it'd still be, like, better to, like, have, like, you build it with.

And then separately, we work to build maybe that invoice flow or something, or, like, if there's another one.

Contractor time and spend that we had on workado, because their support model was primarily have our contractor build it and then have them kind of just advise when.

If you have a department that you want to really integrate this with, I'm happy to connect you with leaders and builders internally that could help you. And the example I usually drop is for hr. Like, we have Rachel Maby, who is like an AI engineer there we have Sarah on Revops, who is like an AI engineer for internally. We're happy to have them run a session within the two weeks. Like, I'm looking for you to actually provide a lot of input within the next two weeks. We could do that or we could go pilot still up in the air. We have like a sink next Wednesday. Happy to go ahead with either plan, but, like, I think that's right now a better option. Than just pushing a pilot.  \nMe: Okay, I'll draft that for you, have that for you. And just maybe, like, 20 minutes or so. And then if you send that out to a group, that'd be great.  \nThem: What was our thought process on not getting them on a trial? Or, I don't know, like how you think about it. Jordan, you're relatively newer, but. Yeah. I don't know. I didn't have any thoughts. I think it was. We were hoping to just move forward with the deal, and then they wanted to move more towards a pilot. And it seemed okay. That was one thing Alex and I both talked about. That was it seemed pretty fuzzy on how are we going to evaluate AutomateFlow Dennis versus Ricardo, because the switching costs, if we're just going to say, like, is it easier to use? That's a very hard metric to say. We're better. Like check the box. Maybe it's a little easier. But we already have ricado. And why would we go and switch? So I think put into a trial, it feels like. I feel like it's totally feasible for us. We can lock down, do some sprints. Is it going to feel like it's rushed for them enough to be, like, a bad experience? That's my limited experience gut saying. Like, is that. Is it going to feel like it's a rushed experience from their end.  \nMe: And I'm particularly concerned with that, with the way Robert is framed, the conversations before. Even if we could prove the value, I think he'll get to the end of the two weeks and be like, oh, we just don't have enough time. Not even if we haven't checked all the boxes. It's just like. Or at least the vibe I get is like, his personalities. He just likes to. Wait on things. But I could be misreading that.  \nThem: And I think that's honestly fine. Like, I truly believe that's okay. So going back to the comment of, like, building enterprise trials. So I was talking to Andrew Weissman, Jordan, and he's like, you know, it's just so weird because, like, people want to go, like, get to Yusuke's activation here at AutomateFlow, and he's like, it's not the. Case at Trey. So that's something like I'm thinking about because I'm very much like use case activation. If we are the ease of use platform. Like, we just have to get there most of the time to win. So I'm happy to get challenged on that. Here's the risk. I'm thinking about Alex for this deal is they're using word like agents. And agentic, and I don't actually know what they mean, and I don't know if we had enough time on that. And a risk that you have is like, we don't price agents right now, and if they, like, get into agents, like that's what they're looking for versus, like, AI. By AutomateFlow like you do, introduce some risk because you're like, oh, by the way, yeah, that product, like, we don't price it right now, just FYI, we can give you a trial. It could cost a lot more money in a few months, so that's something that just. Was maybe a little bit of a concern, but what it also sounds like is, you know, they feel like Workado and us, we're playing in different playing fields. That's totally fine. But I was trying to drop that, like, oh, I actually feel more confident that we could land you guys and then start taking up their recipes, because that's, like. I think that's what he's proven is, like, they're paying per recipe, and, like, their cost per recipe is crazy expensive. And, like, you. Know, we could, like. I almost want to get to a point, which I don't think it's in this two weeks, but it's like, we prove ease of use. You get in, and then you're like, all right, what recipe do you think? It's actually much more cost effective to just move. Off workado.  \nMe: Yeah. Completely, completely agree on the medium term play of prove the value. And it'll just be cheaper to run it on us than it than it is on whatever you're doing on workado. Right. And maybe your next renewal is.  \nThem: It depends. So if it's like a super high, like, task volume, sometimes, like, work auto, because they don't have, like, usage limits. So they have some crazy deals that are like, it's five recipes for, like, 15,000 or $20-50K. So they do that kind of commercial structure, too, where it's like, uncapped usage. But it's just pay per connection. And that's probably where they're like, well, it doesn't FlowBuilder sense for a finance team wanting to do a single thing. And it's like, here's another 15k or whatever amount per recipe. And they talked about EA use cases that might be where you want to also tap into. So be like, what's that EA like? I don't know if they meant executive assistant or. I don't know if you heard that too. Where?  \nMe: Yeah. Sorry I missed that. I didn't hear the ea.  \nThem: I heard them say. Yeah, yeah, I went executive assistant, but that's an assumption. Yeah, they said it was an EA use case on Workado. That might be. That would be a bold but cool move. Is, Jordan, you just say, like, oh, we'll just build that executive. Like, that might actually win you. The deal is, like, if you actually ask them now, like, hey, what's that workflow, like, with the ea? That's interesting. Like, we do a ton of EA stuff. I don't know if you've seen any of Juliana's emails. It's like, hey, here's, like, all.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And if it's the simple one, we could just be like, oh, that thing that's costing you a ton of work, Auto. Like. Like, we could build, like. Yeah, that's like a super easy workflow. We could build that in, like, 15 minutes. There you go. And, like, that saves them 15K or whatever. Amount it might be. So that that could be the other play that you do. But I would dive into that workflow because if a team's already using it and it's an EA team, not like a super technical team using it, it might be worth double clicking on that, because it might just be like, check emails, like, run it through AI and see if it's, like, high priority or not. And it's like, Yeah, that shouldn't be on work auto.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Eah.  \nThem: Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I can drop a whole folder and just drop some of that folder and say, hey, look, here's all these and that are done. Duplicate the ones and we can tweak it. And then now it works exactly how you want. But yeah, I double click on the EA one for sure. And it's like if it is an executive assistant team, you should be like, hey, I'll do a. You can have like any of our EAS run those boot camps. You can be like, hey, I heard about ea. Did you mean executive assistant? We could do a boot camp on it. I'm happy to hear about what those workflows are. Like, we could even just run one of those side by side in two weeks. Like, I feel confident in something that simple. Like, you could run side by side. We could get up and running in days and. And that might actually be easier than invoicing, so.  \nMe: And maybe. I don't know if this is, like, too much for us to do and, like, I could run this one myself, but maybe we do, like, there's that IT Leaders Workshop. And maybe we just do an EA one too, because that's a really easy use case. Lots of what I think of, like, as a productivity use cases, and they can get a lot of value really quickly. And it's like they're close to the executive team on that front. Think about it.  \nThem: Yeah. I want you to use your cards wisely. But I would even just, like, send a message over and be like, hey, you talked about EA use case. What is it? And, like, did you mean executive assistant just so we get a little bit more signal.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay? Cool.  \nThem: Sorry. Last risk. Last risk would call out one of the things too they talked about Bring your own model in the beginning. One of our first calls and that obviously, we don't have any kind of control over that with our agents right now, today, you know, AI by AutomateFlow. Like they can connect their own LLM keys, and that's fine. So just one thing to keep in mind. It's on the roadmap. But it is like they want to use agents. It's going to have to go through our, you know.  \nMe: Well, I mean, I guess this is one, like, question clarification I had. I know they were talking about agents, but I guess based off of the use cases they were describing, I don't have an impression that they actually understand that it's like, that they have a meaningful understanding of the distinction between, like, agents. Versus like, AI steps in practice. And so I definitely get like, they were asking about it, but I from the conversations we've had with Sarah and what they the specific use cases they're talking about, I don't get the impression that, like, they specifically need agents versus, like an AI by AutomateFlow step. That can specifically have that model piece. But there's also. I know we have the. There's like the alpha of the wrang your own model for agents that we might be able to get them on if at the end of this two weeks, it, like, seems like they want more agents in particular.  \nThem: Yep. Let's also strategically think in different altitudes so I can stay high up. So you could just be like, hey, I don't think pilot's the right move. Hey, like, we don't do this, but let me just go ahead and, like, approve a free, free trial like we think would win in these things. Alex, you can just go tactical and be like, tell me about the EA use. Case. Tell me about joining this meeting with the leaders. Tell me about. And I would start, actually, the security paperwork and all of that, because they're going to ask anyway. On it. Like, it might just be worth starting it now to just be like, here's our security center. Here is. I would also just flag, like, hey, like, even as we look about going. Going into, you know, AI steps like, none of our for enterprise customers, none of our models are used for learning. Or what's the word?  \nMe: On the. On the material.  \nThem: For training. Yeah. So just like. Yeah, I would just be tactical. And then the other thing that helps you actually in the long run is next Wednesday. We could be like, listen. You guys need more time, and you're not giving us capacity to actually go ahead and drive these things. Like, I'm not going to continue pushing this out. Like, all right, now you got to, like, put money down, right? Like, we could have that Francis conversation next week if we needed to. It's like. We kind of are holding our end of the bargain. Like we're waiting for you to activate, and so.  \nMe: Okay? Okay, sounds good. I'll have a draft and I'll post an update with, like, all the next steps and stuff that we land on. Talk to you later.  \nThem: See you. Cool. And hopefully you saw, like, where, like, now on the call. Hopefully you're seeing that. Okay. Like, we probably didn't need to, like, spend a lot of time on, like, the pilot stuff. We probably didn't need to spend a lot. Like, hopefully, like, some of the sequencing helps, and that's going to help as you. Yeah. As you get more of these examples in and. Yeah. And because I know sometimes we're like, pilot great, you know, and I think there's, like, a few questions.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: That hopefully help today.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And we might still end up there, but.  \nMe: No, for sure. And I realized. Sorry, I'm taking over your time. I do want to, like, talk more from, like, a coaching perspective, because, like, full transparency. I don't feel great about the ending of the meeting, but I don't know if, like, I becoming. Just because, like, I'm used to, like, oh, you walk out with, like, you have these boxes checked, and I'm like, that just made me, like, a mindset shift that I need to change, right? So yeah.  \nThem: What boxes do you think you didn't check today?  \nMe: Like, I wanted them to, like, see that rubric and be like, yes, I agree with these metrics. Is kind of like, what is what I was. My, like, main goal coming out of the call that I feel like we didn't hit necessarily.  \nThem: Which rubric?  \nMe: Let me show the like criteria page. Page. Yeah, basically, 9 and 10 is what I wanted to, like, get them on.  \nThem: My question is, why not this for the next two weeks? Or a little bit of a pared down version.  \nMe: I mean, that. That actually, in terms of the timeline, I actually don't hate that.  \nThem: Yeah, I. I think.  \nMe: Doing it faster. I completely, I think, is, like, very. We can hit all these criteria, doing it faster. I just. I don't feel like I know what their criteria are still. That makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. Y. Eah. How you can do it is like, hey, we're going to get into the conversation with your leaders. I have a really, like, clear point of view on how I think the next two weeks can go. And these are the things that I think is important as we look at this free trial in the next two weeks. Like, I'd love to get responses on, like, how you feel about it. That's. But that's a thing. Is, like, all of it is based on, like, are we piloting? Are we not? And, like, my initial read on it was, like, the call initially felt a little bit like we wanted to get to this really early, whereas there was a lot we could dive into earlier. So even for the Francis discussion, I would think about when he was like, well, pilot, like, I'm open to it. I think the last question in my view would have should have been like, hey, is this like, are you thinking about this in a paid pilot way or are you thinking about a non paid pilot? And the first thing he's going to say, like, think about, like, the next thing he's going to say, so he's, of course, me, like, I'm open to a paid pilot. Obviously, nobody wants to pay for anything, and it's like, great. Then let's not do a pilot. Let's do a two week. Like, then the conversation would have been like. He's like, oh, great. Like, if that's an option, Great. Sarah and I James talk about it in the next 30 minutes. Cool. See you later. And he's going to go away with like. Oh, like, I might have actually saved money over time and. But I could still send that out. A couple other things. Like? One is the purpose. Process. Payoff. I thought it was good. Actually, I don't really have feedback on it. Usually, like, we don't show it in that way, just so you know.  \nMe: You said customer face. I thought you meant like. Sorry. That makes. Okay.  \nThem: No, no, no, that's fine. It's like, how are we positioning the call? It's like, hey, today's call also big thing on team selling. Like, always start with like, hey, like, you set up the convo with like, hey, we have, like, Horizon Ventures pioneering team. This is the team. Like, I've been working with Sarah. This is our AutomateFlow team. Like, Jordan's here with me. Kyung Ho's here with me. Like, this is like our roles in the conversation. Like, set us up. I kind of have to do the awkward. Like, hey, guys, like, what's up? Later. So I think that was another one. We'll. We'll get there. But hopefully like that also help with just like.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense.  \nThem: Yeah, I was trying to also figure out if. Like, even slide three was worth our time today, where if we already heard the pilot, like, I wonder if we just, like, could have skipped that, actually. So you could have just been like, hey, we were thinking about more long term, but I think the conversation today can actually sit on shorter term with pilots, right? So it. I know these are, like, small details. You're going to get your bearings, right? But. But hopefully that makes sense, which is like, he brought up, like, Pilot again right from the beginning, and it was like, okay, great. Like, I had more on, like, what the future looks like, and I think there's a lot. Here, but, like, let's actually dive a little bit deeper into, like, these ideas. But hopefully that discussion part really helped, like, hone in on some of those discussions. And hopefully you saw that, because if we did it, we would have just been speaking to them the whole time.  \nMe: Thanks.  \nThem: So I thought that discussion one was really good. Yeah. It also took me by surprise a little bit because I was like. I was thinking about it like a doc for us to be like, hey, like, we need to get these things out. But I didn't communicate. And I also thought it was great. To be honest, I thought it was great. Like, I'm honestly, like, maybe we just do this in calls, like, and just bring it out. Because he even said it too. He's like, yep, the past software purchase. Like, I don't want to do that. So maybe we use that phrasing to just be like, hey, you mentioned this. Kyung Ho was like, why don't. We just do a truly free trial. Get. Get in.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: You know, and be like, I know. And be like, Francis and Sarah was up for citizen development. Like, now, if we have the security controls, like, I've already sent documents over, but, like, we want to do that.  \nMe: Frame it. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes.  \nThem: You know, since we are a paid pilot, like, Kyung Ho was like, hey, let's like even reduce the risk further for Horizon Ventures pioneering so that they don't have to put any money up front. And we try to do a sprint in two weeks. And, like, nobody's going to say no to that, in my opinion. Like, they're going to feel like we're meeting them in the middle.  \nMe: Yeah, sounds good. Okay.  \nThem: But long time, but hopefully. I feel like you kind of got away from a pilot, which is also nice.  \nMe: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I mean, I think they agreed to the two weeks. We'll see. I think. Yeah, like I mentioned, the Robert. I could see Robert at the end of two weeks. Still just being like. I just need more time. Even. Even if we, like, check all those boxes and. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see what happens.  \nThem: That's fine. That's fine. But. But I think that's where we say things like, yeah, I mean, it's. That's for another day. And we could even talk about Summit. Like, maybe we even have a sink at Summit with that. But that's the time I would say, like, we then. Shift the conversation to, okay, like, what have we not hit? And Sarah. And like. And that's fine. Like, they can just say what it is, but right now, I don't think they even have criteria for the pilot.  \nMe: Yeah. Y. Eah, I agree.  \nThem: And we would have just wasted our time. In my opinion, like, next to three calls James be on. What's the pilot going to be? What's the pilot going to be? What's the pilot? What's the criteria? So I think this is either way. I think it's going to be positive to just. Like, get momentum, because. And Jordan knows this, too. Like, if it's a pilot, he needs to work with them for three months.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: Cool. All right, I'll let you go because I'm super late to Obby Obi. I saw you dropped off, and you're probably, like,  \nMe: Makes sense. Oh, my God. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/860cbaff-85f1-4c6d-8ad8-d49442119d2d](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/860cbaff-85f1-4c6d-8ad8-d49442119d2d)\n",

Or at least the vibe I get is like, his personalities. He just likes to. Wait on things. But I could be misreading that."

So I was talking to Andrew Weissman, Jordan, and he's like, you know, it's just so weird because, like, people want to go, like, get to Yusuke's activation here at AutomateFlow, and he's like, it's not the. Case at Trey. So that's something like I'm thinking about because I'm very much like use case activation. If we are the ease of use platform. Like, we just have to get there most of the time to win. So I'm happy to get challenged on that. Here's the risk. I'm thinking about Alex for this deal is they're using word like agents. And agentic, and I don't actually know what they mean, and I don't know if we had enough time on that. And a risk that you have is like, we don't price agents right now, and if they, like, get into agents, like that's what they're looking for versus, like, AI. By AutomateFlow like you do, introduce some risk because you're like, oh, by the way, yeah, that product, like, we don't price it right now, just FYI, we can give you a trial. It could cost a lot more money in a few months, so that's something that just. Was maybe a little bit of a concern, but what it also sounds like is, you know, they feel like Workado and us, we're playing in different playing fields. That's totally fine. But I was trying to drop that, like, oh, I actually feel more confident that we could land you guys and then start taking up their recipes, because that's, like. I think that's what he's proven is, like, they're paying per recipe, and, like, their cost per recipe is crazy expensive. And, like, you. Know, we could, like. I almost want to get to a point, which I don't think it's in this two weeks, but it's like, we prove ease of use. You get in, and then you're like, all right, what recipe do you think? It's actually much more cost effective to just move. Off workado."

So they have some crazy deals that are like, it's five recipes for, like, 15,000 or $20-50K. So they do that kind of commercial structure, too, where it's like, uncapped usage. But it's just pay per connection. And that's probably where they're like, well, it doesn't FlowBuilder sense for a finance team wanting to do a single thing. And it's like, here's another 15k or whatever amount per recipe. And they talked about EA use cases that might be where you want to also tap into. So be like, what's that EA like? I don't know if they meant executive assistant or. I don't know if you heard that too. Where?"

The deal is, like, if you actually ask them now, like, hey, what's that workflow, like, with the ea? That's interesting. Like, we do a ton of EA stuff.

We could build that in, like, 15 minutes. There you go. And, like, that saves them 15K or whatever. Amount it might be. So that that could be the other play that you do. But I would dive into that workflow because if a team's already using it and it's an EA team, not like a super technical team using it, it might be worth double clicking on that, because it might just be like, check emails, like, run it through AI and see if it's, like, high priority or not.

You can have like any of our EAS run those boot camps. You can be like, hey, I heard about ea. Did you mean executive assistant? We could do a boot camp on it. I'm happy to hear about what those workflows are. Like, we could even just run one of those side by side in two weeks. Like, I feel confident in something that simple.

And so I definitely get like, they were asking about it, but I from the conversations we've had with Sarah and what they the specific use cases they're talking about, I don't get the impression that, like, they specifically need agents versus, like an AI by AutomateFlow step. That can specifically have that model piece. But there's also. I know we have the. There's like the alpha of the wrang your own model for agents that we might be able to get them on if at the end of this two weeks, it, like, seems like they want more agents in particular."

Like, I'd love to get responses on, like, how you feel about it. That's. But that's a thing. Is, like, all of it is based on, like, are we piloting? Are we not? And, like, my initial read on it was, like, the call initially felt a little bit like we wanted to get to this really early, whereas there was a lot we could dive into earlier. So even for the Francis discussion, I would think about when he was like, well, pilot, like, I'm open to it. I think the last question in my view would have should have been like, hey, is this like, are you thinking about this in a paid pilot way or are you thinking about a non paid pilot? And the first thing he's going to say, like, think about, like, the next thing he's going to say, so he's, of course, me, like, I'm open to a paid pilot. Obviously, nobody wants to pay for anything, and it's like, great. Then let's not do a pilot. Let's do a two week. Like, then the conversation would have been like. He's like, oh, great. Like, if that's an option, Great. Sarah and I James talk about it in the next 30 minutes. Cool. See you later. And he's going to go away with like. Oh, like, I might have actually saved money over time and. But I could still send that out. A couple other things. Like? One is the purpose. Process. Payoff. I thought it was good.

I know these are, like, small details. You're going to get your bearings, right? But. But hopefully that makes sense, which is like, he brought up, like, Pilot again right from the beginning, and it was like, okay, great. Like, I had more on, like, what the future looks like, and I think there's a lot. Here, but, like, let's actually dive a little bit deeper into, like, these ideas.

Good morning.  \nThem: Morning. Good morning.  \nMe: How are you guys doing? Have a good week.  \nThem: Yes. I'm sorry, but I James have to leave at 9 because I have anointing that was not planned before yesterday night late.  \nMe: Okay? No worries.  \nThem: Me as well on that one front and I are in the same 9am meeting.  \nMe: Okay, great.  \nThem: Apologies in advance.  \nMe: No worries. Emma, great to meet you. We probably won't have a time to answer everyone's questions then in that 30 minutes, but there's a couple of key points we want to FlowBuilder sure we hit while we have the full group. So let me just go ahead and jump in since we know we're short. On time. So kind of today, there's three goals that I'm kind of want to FlowBuilder sure we get through one falling up on our last conversation. And I know that there's been some internal conversations in terms of path forward since then, but still want to just share what does a partnership with us look like to help paint that picture of how we help you actually get set up for success. Two. We want to talk about what the path forward looks like. So what is the evaluation criteria that you guys are actually using? How are we thinking about success? What are, like, the metrics you would need to see to be like, hey, we feel really confident that AutomateFlow was going to help us transform our vision. And then finally, we just want to figure out what are the tactical next steps and how do we align on what's going forward? I want to FlowBuilder sure. Is that in line with what you guys want out of this conversation? If we walk out with these three things, are you happy? Do we feel like we have a path forward? Or is there anything else you specifically want to FlowBuilder sure we cover in this time?  \nThem: It looks like a good list to me. I don't know, Emma, maybe just for like, 30 seconds of context for you, because I know we've had some back and forth on this, but maybe not the full picture. So we had a demo from the AutomateFlow team last week, David, Robert and I, and we've. Been talking about how do we FlowBuilder progress in Q1, but also how do we pick the right platform for the enterprise. Obviously, we've had this vision of maybe in Q2 or Q3 of this year, we want to start bringing other people onto the platform, allow people to develop agents. And so where we landed, the direction that Robert and I are trying to go in as maybe it's worthwhile doing a pilot first before we open it up to the full enterprise so that we really understand what it would take to kind of get up the curve in terms of understanding how to use the tool. And I think it gives us a little bit more time to FlowBuilder sure we understand fully all of the security pieces, too. I love a good pilot approach, so appreciate that. Yeah. Awesome.  \nMe: Awesome. Okay. So first, I just want to kind of describe the partnership a little bit. Last time you'd asked about what does it look like for you guys to actually partners with going forward? Like we mentioned, we have the TAM hours, we have the essay, helping you with onboarding, we have all these other programs. But what does that actually mean for you guys in practice? So what we wanted to lay out is kind of how we think about this in terms of phases. Where one is we build together. So this is in the initial time period Jordan and Sarah are building side by side to actually capture that sort of 390k of annual value that. Sarah's mapped out from just those two sort of initial use cases. And the goal here is sort of. Have Jordan help accelerate the build while Sarah is learning so that by the end of this period, it's done and working. But there's also a strong institutional knowledge that Sarah has. Then we start to say, okay, now that Sarah's been enabled, how do we think about spreading this more broadly across the org? So Sarah is trained, the TAM is continuing to build more complex things going forward. So if there's, like, another use case that requires lots of coordination across the org, the TAM can, like, FlowBuilder sure those are done for you guys. But then we're also enabling you to do 80 to 90% of the types of tasks that people would use AutomateFlow for. You can build yourself. You can enable your team to build them in a secure way with controls. And then that gets the people on the platform. And then once people are on the platform, it almost becomes a question of, okay, what are. What are people actually prioritizing? What's important to them? And that then drives and informs the path forward. And overall, the value, the sort of goal and what I would say thesis. Statement is we want. We want you to get to a place where you don't need a TAM to support every build, but you always have the strategic guidance to understand what's next. I James pause and like ask for questions, thoughts, reactions from the group in terms of hey, like, based off of this list, do you feel like you would have the support you need to actually enable people? Are there a specific follow up questions that you have tied to this. And I guess maybe like David and Robert in particular, I know you guys had questions around what support looks like. How do we handle spikiness, for example?  \nThem: Again. Going back to what Sarah said, it's important if we can do a pilot. It's a way to test the partnership and the way of working together. I would say I'm confidant that this is okay, this approach is okay for Pilot. And then again, it's the opportunity to fine tune and understand what we need to work if we decide to work on a longer partnership. Long term partnership.  \nMe: Yeah. That's actually might be a good segue. So we had a couple of questions that we wanted to talk through. Like, in terms of how you guys were thinking about the pilot, kind of where we fit into this overall structure. So I know one of the things, I was talking to Sarah, she mentioned that part of what's driving the pilot interest is you feel like you've made software purchase in the past, like, too quickly. Haven't necessarily gotten the value from that that you expected during the buying process. Could you talk to me a bit about, like, a bit about that context in history there?  \nThem: I'm afraid that any one of us was here when it happened. But we know that we have software at Horizon Ventures today that are not used or not exactly what the best in class that we wouldn't select today. So it was more reference to what we have today. Not our personal history with Horizon Ventures.  \nMe: That makes sense. That makes a ton sense.  \nThem: I mean, to most didn't purchase a lot of software that we don't use.  \nMe: That makes a lot of sense. And I guess, how do you think about the time us versus Workado in your setup? Like, are you in particular if when we're. When we were talking about, like, hey, let's get Sarah up to speed and just get started, we were kind of talking about, hey, us and Ricotta are going to be doing separate things because the things that work Auto is doing would take longer for us to actually get set up. There's some time investment involved in potentially moving those over. Curious if you. Are you guys thinking about that the same way if we're talking about doing pilot before. Moving forward.  \nThem: Not sure. Question. Yeah, Maybe I can jump in here. So my understanding is, on the workado platform, we have the orchestration piece of it today, and we have a couple of different workflows built out that are working well for our EA team. And then this agentic piece is kind of. They said, go ahead, experiment with our AI. Agent capabilities. But that is something that in the future, unlike the orchestration side of the house, we want to open up to the company more broadly, to say everyone should be able to create their own agents. I think to me, I mean, David, this is probably an enterprise applications question as well, is how do we see it? I don't think we want the agent platform to disrupt what we have on the orchestration side. I could see it working in the long term, where we say we use Work Auto for orchestration and we use AutomateFlow for agents and citizen development. That could be an option. Or we could say maybe it's one platform for both. But I recognize in that second scenario there would be rework. That's required with rebuilding what we have on the existing orchestration side, so that's probably not ideal, unless we feel like there are gaps. Yeah, I agree with that. Sarah David can comment as well, but has been the middleware for Horizon Ventures for several years. Now at the teams are very happy with Warcato as a middleware. And so now we are at this stage where it's not only the traditional middleware, it's AI that we need to orchestrator. This is where we need to understand what is the best solution for us. In terms of orchestration or for AI.  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: Hey everybody. If. If you don't mind me jumping in. So I think we didn't do intros. My name is Kyungho. We're also here with Jordan. So all of us on the AutomateFlow team, really excited to be here. I run our mid market team, our SMB teams, our sales. Assist teams and joined AutomateFlow about four years ago. We didn't have a sales team back then, so it's just two people really excited to see our growth and excited to hear about this from Alex. And he pulled me in recently just in terms of the conversation that you know where the conversation was going. Here. What's interesting, maybe this is for David. That I'd love to understand is our whole market positioning actually is orchestration platform is where AutomateFlow positions ourselves in the market today. What I'm hearing is Workado is not one of these purchases where, hey, we're just not getting the usage. Out of it. I feel what I'm hearing is, like, you guys are actually getting really good value out of it. Now that you're thinking about bringing AutomateFlow into the platform, I'd love to hear, like, where the differences are. So we also say, like, everybody's perception of a product is probably three, four years behind, right? So even when I think about TeamChat or any of the products we use, I think about the capabilities of three, four years ago. And so AutomateFlow has done a lot of work to now work with a lot of enterprise. Right. So when you think about very large enterprises using us as an orchestration layer, I'm interested in David or Sarah. How do you think about now in this new stage? Let's say AutomateFlow gets online. How do you think about what goes to work Auto and what goes to AutomateFlow? I don't. Know if it's a cost thing, a use thing. Let's say we like, play in the same field and I'll go through the intricacies and we'll be very upfront about it, but would love to hear more. The driving force behind our exploration of AutomateFlow was never to be a replacement for what David and team have already built in Mercado. That's working well to Robert's point, around the middleware and the orchestration workflows that are already built. There's no part of this conversation that's not working well today, and we need to replace that. I think our driving force was wanting to pick an agent building platform for the rest of the organization that's beyond it and thinking about our AI roadmap and that is new functionality that the Work Auto team has been telling us they have. And we were trying to compare a like solution on the AutomateFlow. Side. So that, like, AI piece of it is really what's driving the exploration. And I think the decision is, you know, on the orchestration side, given that both platforms also do that. Right. Like, what's the right choice there? I feel less. You know, I think saying that's more your team's decision. Than mine. Yeah, and I think I James add to that. I think optionality is really, you know, how we're approaching this. This is the whole agentic movement and all that. It's fairly new. And we went with WADO because it's a middleware that we already have a relationship with. And I think bringing in AutomateFlow would give us just a. Broader view of what the capabilities are, the usability and how it fits our company. So, yeah, I think that. I think I can say we're not locked into Wacato. Like if you if that. As if AutomateFlow offers moisture line solution. Let's talk even on the orchestration side. Yeah. Just to echo what David said, this market is evolving so fast. The market, the orchestration market. We need to stay very agile on this and understand what is the best solution for the future for Horizon Ventures. So, again, let's try, let's pilot it, and we'll be able to see what is the robust. Interest. No, I think that's a. I think that's a great place to start the conversation and I think framing wise really important. I'm going to get to the pilot question. I just have one more to go. But on the discussion around, you know, having both platforms on at the same time, I just wanted to understand David. My understand a lot of times with Workado is they're built off recipes, Right. And so you probably have some kind of commercial structure that's, hey, these are top five, these are top ten. And, you know, they're really based off these use cases being X amount and really, you know, driving that all the way start to end and building those workflows. Is that the type of, like, structure that you have with Workado? I just want to FlowBuilder sure we're not just adding something that we honestly could also see, like, hey, just go with work, Auto. This might actually be a better fit for you, but. But we want to FlowBuilder sure that we get that upfront before we even go into a pilot conversation, even if it is. Yeah, that's right, Kyung. That's the setup that we have. Yeah. So one of the differences probably that you've seen with work Auto and AutomateFlow is, I mean, we've always done much better, probably, and that citizen development portion of the business and where that's also helped most of the time, and I think I'm hearing from Sarah is we have, like, three workflows. Three. Three or four use cases that are pretty high priority. I think we've probably found really good ROI in them. I think I heard numbers like 250k in R Y. Just with one use case that we have, you can get those up and running very quickly on AutomateFlow and then test and iterate, Right? So being able to get those, we don't charge per, like recipe equivalents, we actually charge per outcomes. Right? So actions that we run on those platforms, which sometimes in terms of work auto commercial structure is a little different. I never recommend moving something from AutomateFlow over to work auto. And they probably won't either. But I also know some people have started, like, what they're using AutomateFlow for is getting that iteration really quickly and saying, okay, now do we feel like we actually move that over to Workado as a recipe in the future where it's a different commercial structure that you're building. I don't know if you're thinking about it in that way. If it's like, no, we haven't even thought about that, that's totally fine, but I just wanted to get a lay of the land. So as you open the door, it's a Vitaly, but definitely the economic aspect would be a large part of the decision making. So we'll have to speak about this part first. We need to see if it works for us. And then, of course, the economic value James be a huge part of the decision as well. And I think, you know, in Q3, Q4 this year, like, I could see if we did adopt AutomateFlow form an enterprise point of view. Some of the first use cases that we probably have people working on from a citizen development standpoint is like, okay, read my inbox, give me the reminders of what's coming up. Or my right, like more of those types rather than a, hey, let's get our netsuite systems to talk to each other, which is more of what we've been working on on the, you know, we're caught at orchestration side is connectivity between the apps. And so I think the way that you described it with like citizen development versus very business critical workflows that are about app to app connectivity and orchestration are right now like in my mind, kind of two buckets of things. And that second bucket. Let's continue the conversation on. But our primary driver for I think, wanting to explore AutomateFlow is more of that. That first bucket. Yeah. And I don't want to speak on behalf of. We don't want anyone to be able to build automatic update of Netflix or whatever system. So, yes, we need to be very clear also in the security and what is feasible, what is not feasible. For the jr users. And also we better myself, thanks. I said. Couldn't have said it better myself. We have a lot of people here who want to innovate and try things, which were very pro doing with the proper guardrails in place. But we need to FlowBuilder sure that AutomateFlow offers us the necessary security controls to monitor and potentially enforce behavior in a certain way. And on the citizen side, we need to understand also, because here it's not versus work at all, it's maybe versus Microsoft. For instance, what you demonstrated last week, I did the same. I had done the same before with Microsoft. So we need also to understand where AutomateFlow brings value compared to the solution that we have already. And I'd assume that that's like a Power Automate. A workflow. Yes, Microsoft workflow. Okay. Microsoft work for us. Yeah. Yeah. I think these are all really great points and I hear, like, where the conversation is going on pilots. Part of the reason I got on the call is for two reasons. One is just to kind of talk about how we run pilots. What, you know, when we run pilots and why we usually don't run pilots is actually the last part. So I just want to be clear there. So part of why we don't run a pilot is for two reasons. I hear you on, you know, a lot of the citizen development concerns that you have. Let's say we solve all of that through our security review. Like, you'll see allowed apps, you'll see all those features that we have. Like, we wouldn't have an enterprise product. Without that. So let's say those are table stakes that we could roll out into the team. You can even have approvals, right? So through a JIRA ticket, you could say, hey, I want access to more apps. It's more of a case by case. We can decide how we build that out. Part of the reason why we don't do a pilot, especially for a product like AutomateFlow, is because I think we lose the citizen development model. If we go a pilot model. So what that means is you have a pilot for three months and then you're launching and you're actually pushing back all of your citizen development because we actually don't really onboard you until after that three month period of time. So I think that's like the first concern that I have is when we're doing a rollout, we want to FlowBuilder sure that we're doing a full rollout where we're connecting to all of your systems, because that's also another thing where, I mean, it does open us us to more risk. That's why we don't do the onboarding initially is because if you're connecting to all your apps, it's going to take us a lot of time. But you know, if you're not doing a whole rollout with the company because, you know, if it's TeamChat or Microsoft, you probably are not doing a pilot and then deciding if you're continuing after three months. So that's, that's one of the big things. So maybe. So I'm trying to figure out, like, ROI in this conversation, and so we can even just hop into commercials next if we wanted to. But maybe the question for I'm trying to figure out is we have a use case that we have that Sarah, you've been working with Jordan. Like, how's. Like, where are we on that use case? Alex gave me a little bit of a heads up, but what I'm trying to figure out is, do we even have enough ROI we're there with the use case, enough to actually prove, like, hey, we have all the connections. We can actually have this. Workflow go live and what kind of assurances we can give your team for a full rollout, you know, if we need to figure out a commercial structure that, you know, figures out an opt out. I mean, we can talk about those things later, but we usually do not go for pilots, and that's why I wanted to join the conversation for that, so maybe Sarah, I'll pass it to you and Jordan of how the workflow and the initial workflow has been going and if we're already essentially there, if we have more time. Yeah, maybe just to explain and I, you know, I appreciate your point of view on, you know, you guys not typically doing pilots. I think for me, especially because it's meant to be a citizen development platform, we need to validate and understand what it James take for people to get up the curve. Like, I can't sit here and confidently say, like, everyone across Horizon Ventures James be able to use this and we should invest, you know, six months enrolling this out across the entire organization if I haven't, like, used it and felt confident that, like, you know, a. We can, we can cover both types of use cases, right? Use case one. Is like, help me automate my calendar, more of the everyday use cases, and then two from a roadmap point of view, some of the quick win use cases we have on there that we'll want to continue building out from an AI perspective in the next couple of months. And so, you know, the use case that Jordan and I are working on for invoice automation. That one has a solid ROI story to it. I think, you know, we want to see by the end of Q1. I'm confident it's possible with AutomateFlow, we want to see the quality of the output that I think James give us a good proxy. For one, how long did it take for us to really understand and learn how to use the platform? And what was that experience like as a proxy for how the rest of the organization James receive it. And, you know, two, can we also build more technically complex workflows that actually drive that ROI so that we have a solid ROI story to go to senior leadership with and, you know, to put in front of Robert and say yes with AutomateFlow, we're confident that all of these different business use cases are possible in addition to citizen development. And that's why we should invest in AutomateFlow. And just to add on. Sorry. Just to add on to that. I know Sarah shared with you guys the UK on the invoice processing is do you guys have a recommendation in terms of any agentic solutions that you have pre built where it showcases the citizen development path that we want to go right out of the gate? So maybe we can do that in parallel on the use case that we propose. And also we could be the pilot of those pre built ones that is much more straightforward and doesn't require workflow, additional workflow mapping that Jordan is working on. Again. Coming back to the box. Number one on your slider. We don't want to FlowBuilder a decision with AutomateFlow before we know that it's the good solution for us. We are motivated, very motivated, to test and to see if it can be the right solution. But we want Rush to. To FlowBuilder an agreement for a full rollout if we don't know. If we are not convinced that it's the right solution for us. Yeah, and I think that's totally fair. One of the things I'm just. Like, considering right now. I know we have four minutes, so I know we'll speed through a couple of the next parts pretty quickly, but one of the things we could do is we could even do a trial. So usually what we do is like, we do like a two week period of a full trial. You guys can. Get into the platform thing, as you said, we have a lot of those, like, great agentic, you know, products that we have internally and templates that we have internally where you can even just see, hey, what happens when big ones that we have is we have like a candidate fraud flag. So on the people side, candidate fraud flag. We have retention risk. You know, builders. A lot of these different things that we have. We're so horizontal. That's the beauty of AutomateFlow. And also what's tough, right? In these situations, if you have things that feel very clear, I think, Sarah, you add ones on calendar and so forth is something. That we could go ahead and drive. With maybe a few minutes left. I'm debating going back and forth on this. But Alex, maybe we could go to the next slide, which is really on what are commercial structure was going to be if it was not a pilot. And this is essentially all we have right now. I heard about the change. I think it was a day ago, so hopefully it doesn't show up. Like, we're not prepared. We just usually don't pipeline or pilots in the same way. But this is usually what the partnership would be. The reason I also thought this was really important to bring up right now is because there is. There is also an opportunity that we're saying, hey, this is not in the budget. Like, when you're looking at an orchestration platform, how you're looking to build. So this is the platform that we have right now, or it might even behave for citizen development. Like, we have this budget. We could go ahead and drive this budget today. So I wanted to get like, while everybody's here, before we move to the next step, this is what our structure would look like. The pilot structure would look very different. We usually front load a lot of the cost, and there is a premium that we go ahead and add into a pilot that would increase this annual investment that you put in that's usually where I also say it's maybe not a good fit if we could rather just push the deal back a couple weeks and you can actually, let's say we get the use case up in live, or maybe we go ahead and show those citizen development portions and like not go through a pilot. So wanted to get reactions before. Maybe. I think Robert and I think Emma had to hop, but maybe we get some feedback on this. Again. I have one minute, so I have to be very brief. But we won't move unless we can pull ourselves. We won't pay AutomateFlow even before we can prove ourselves that. That it can be a good ocean for us. So I'm open to discussions on the best way to do it, but the goal is. We can call it Pork Pilot, whatever we need. To be able to test before we move forward. I need to go, but we can continue. This discussion as another time. Maybe Sarah and David have a few more minutes to discuss with you. But to test.  \nMe: Real quick. Sorry, Robert. Before you jump, I did want to just show what we're going to be talking about with Robert and Sarah for the rest of this time. Talking around the structure of the pilot just to give you a sense of, like, where we're going. What I'm hoping to lay out effectively is, like, get to a rubric around, like, hey, here are the specific criteria we want to judge. I James work with Thing and Sarah on, like, the specifics of this. But just so you know, we are thinking for it around, like, what does this pilot actually look like in practice? And that's kind of what we'll focus on over the next bit of the section.  \nThem: Okay? Thank you. And I James discuss with David and Emmy, and we can have another discussion with you in the coming days. Thank you very much. Have a good day for the short meeting.  \nMe: Thank you.  \nThem: Okay, thanks. Matt. Yeah, maybe. Maybe just a quick reaction, like, I think option wise, it sounds like we could do either the two week trial, which I'm interested in understanding. Would that just look like, hey, you guys have turned on the, like, Enterprise trial, and we go in and play with it and there's, like, minimal support from your team or whether it's still, like, I would get some hands on, you know, time from Jordan and others. That sounds like maybe option one is option two. Is like a more structured three month pilot. And then option three is like going in right away on the total annual investment, which it doesn't sound like Robert is interested in. So I think. I think it sounds like we're playing between options one and two. But let me know, am I interpreting that correctly? And then what would the primary distinction be between those two options? Yeah. I think for us, we want to FlowBuilder up the gap for you, whichever way that that makes sense. So in terms of, like, our support with Jordan, our support with other teams, like, that support James continue going on. So that. That's something that we want to. We want to FlowBuilder clear up front. Maybe the question for me is pilot. Whenever we use that word, it is a paid pilot. So we don't offer a. Not paid pilot. Would Robert? It was one of the questions I was thinking about asking before he hopped. But is that an option? I don't know how like David. Maybe you have a better understanding. Of this, if that's something that you guys have tried before, or if he's like, we don't want to do any payments, like, we could just go the trial route, right? Like, it just makes that decision easier. So I didn't ask that question, but David or Sarah, I don't know if. You have context on. Like, if I know pilots, some people use that as a free trial word, and sometimes they use it as a like, I don't want to put any, like, money down on a product before. So I and I would be curious David you you've worked with Robert for longer, but I think it probably depends on the scope that we're talking about. A bit like if, if doing a paid pilot is going to get more build support for me because I am a one person team and, you know, don't don't have a lot of resources behind me. I do think that's a conversation Robert would be willing to have, like, if it's going to help us get to, you know, kind of guarantee Q1 good outcome that we read back to the rest of our leadership team. Like, I, you know, I don't think that's out of the question at all. Versus if it were completely free. If that means, like, we wouldn't really get a lot of support, we can have that conversation. It's like, what the specifics look like. I don't think the door is closed for a paid pilot. It's just we don't want to sign up for any sort of annual contract or multi year contract without having done that eval. Yeah, I agree. Okay, that's, that's helpful. Part of why I also mentioned that is for pilots, we have to be very clear on our, like, we have to go through, like, multiple calls, and it's like, this is, like, what we need to hit because we want to FlowBuilder sure that, like, the customer, like, just as a risk perspective. We need to FlowBuilder sure the customer doesn't back out and just say, like, great. That's built great. And then you just say, like, all right, I'm going to take that over to work auto and be like, can you guys build us in a recipe? Like, it's risks that we're obviously just being in an open market like we are. We are open to, but that's where a pilot does get very complicated. And we'll ask for multiple checkpoints all the way up the ladder. So we'll have multiple of these discussions just to FlowBuilder sure that we're hitting all our metrics. So sometimes that's why we would rather front load some of the support. So, Sarah, when you talk about a little bit of handholding, Jordan can definitely help out. Like, how do we go ahead and give you support for these use cases to go live? So maybe the conversation changes to so. So that's why I also think it's cleaner to say, like, let's do a free trial. One of the concerns I heard is, like, not connecting to. To your platforms. We could have a full enterprise trial. You know, we can lock down your account, maybe have you, maybe, like, two other people have access. We do need to work with. It. And so, David, you know, that might be something where you decide, like, oh, do I need. Do I want to put that investment? We also like that better to say, we want you to put the investment of having it go through all that work, even without an agreement. But it's something that we could do to say, hey, we could do like a two week run to go into a full partnership. If we proved out, let's say, your first use case, if we proved out a couple of those citizen development portions, how do we actually get to that minimum Viable, like product for your team is something that we could consider that might even be. Cleaner for, for the rest of the group. So hopefully that makes sense in terms of like it's not just a back out of a pilot, but I'd rather push something like that to just give you guys confidence, not have money exchange. But really, hopefully we just drive value and get to a full deal. Yeah. Let me just be really candid, though. When we set out on this, as you know, we have the Wacado platform, the use cases that we have. I think that we can easily just use Wakado for all of it. I think that this engagement here is really giving AutomateFlow a chance to prove what you guys have, you know, and the concept that you brought up earlier about leveraging the AutomateFlow resources and then moving to a cutoff, that is not the intention at all. Like, we have the resources in Wacado to do all of that. We're really just taking a second look at another option. And then with the potential of picking the best one and moving forward. And to Robert's point, you know, we don't know much about AutomateFlow. What you guys can do. Bukhara is a known product to us. So I really, you know, from my standpoint, that's the lens that I'm looking through. Yeah. And I think if I had to kind of get tactical on, like, what are, what are we really looking for and what are some of those success criteria? There's one part of it on the citizen development side, which is can we do sessions with our IT leadership team or other folks across the enterprise executives to show them. Like, here's how you could use AutomateFlow platform to FlowBuilder your day to day productivity easier. Here's how you can set up agents, right? Like that kind of. And get the feedback and understand like was it easy for them to use? Did they get value from that or be interested in opening that up? To the entire company as a platform. And then the second outcome is showing that more complex build is possible and understanding, you know, the head to head comparison on how easy was that more complex workflow to build from a central IT point of view, Where we able to really get like, a robust, robust workflow going that we feel like, gave us, like, the quality of output that we wanted. And what was that experience of building that versus, you know, what the build experience would have been like in ricotta? Right. So whichever structure, I think, helps us get to that endpoint. On evaluation, and whether we structure that as a free trial or pilot or, you know, paid or not, like, you guys, let me know what's easiest on. On your end and what you know, can help us get there. But I wouldn't want to be in this scenario where, you know, we're just saying, like, all right. You guys play around with it for two weeks. Because I feel like I probably would not be able to represent AutomateFlow in the best light to the rest of the organization and actually get that experience, because I know, like, from playing around with it initially, that there are things that I'm missing and that I don't know how to do, and I wouldn't be able to effectively train others on. Yeah, I think both of them. First of all, David, really appreciate you being candid. That's what we're here for. To also be like. We're trying to, like, figure out risk on our side and the same thing on your team. So I really appreciate bringing that up. I would also be lying if I wasn't saying like, hey, I've also been in a lot of these work auto like discussions where I think you've had a great experience. I've also heard the opposite, which is like, hey, we're 10 months in and it's like, it is a lot more of a technical product. We're having just a hard time shipping things out with that team, is what we've heard. Like, we want to win, right? Like, as an orchestration layer is what we want to win. That's part of our goal, too, in the long run, is what we want to do. So hopefully we prove ourselves is the goal. I want to just FlowBuilder sure that we drive confidence, I think for your team. I know I'm driving this question back to you again, but would like a two week period where, I mean, you have Jordan support. We can even get a external TeamChat channel going. I don't know if you're a TeamChat TeamChat shop or not.  \nMe: We actually have one already.  \nThem: Okay, great. Like, that could be somewhere where we continue providing support. We could even open up Citizen Development, if you would like. So that's something that we do with a lot of our customers, is they just go, we're going to open this up and actually, like, drive Citizen Development, let's say on the marketing. Team or on the HR team and drive it in one of those teams and, like, get enough signal for your team. Because again, like, as I said before, like, that onboarding part is missed a little bit when we go through a pilot, because essentially the experience is going to be very similar to what you get in a two week period. Right. Because we're just going to say these are the success criteria over three months or whatever time period it might be. And some people activate a lot quicker if we ever go into that with, with very large enterprises. But I'm almost trying to think of a way that just gives you confidence where we say, we'll give you the platform. Maybe we even do a single boot camp. So we have, like, an AI. We have AI engineers. We have folks that can run a boot camp. Up to, like, nine folks on your team, get that up and running. And if that's a timeline you want to drive, but or David. I don't know if this is something where you're like, I want to look at reliability over three months. I want to look at, you know, what adoption looks like over three months, and, like, we're willing to pay for that. I'm just trying to get signal on either one, which, again, we're happy to drive whatever works best for you, but. Yeah. Question back to you guys. I think that if we are doing a three month pilot. I think all of it. All those are in play in terms of our evaluation process, which is the provider to go forward with. So we started out the year with a set of business cases that we want to apply a genetic solution to. And so with that list, we've carved out a use case. And in fact, it's the simplest use case, right, that we have. And intend to explore AutomateFlow with as a pilot. So at the same time we have other use cases, some more complex ones going on with Waddle. And this agentic setup that we have with Wacado is also very new to us. And this is a good opportunity when we're starting out just to see what options we have. We don't have a long term setup with Wacoto and, yeah. With this dispositions us to really. Evaluate this in a fair manner. And then FlowBuilder a decision that's best for a company. I think with the two week period. So maybe just questions for you on how that would work. So say we get to the end of the two weeks and we're not done building this invoice assistant. Which maybe, maybe this is because I'm naive and haven't, like, I'm not a AutomateFlow. Power user, but I question a little bit the possibility of us actually getting, like, a high quality MVP up and running in two weeks. Just knowing that there's a bit of a learning curve for me, even with Jordan support. And I've, like, really appreciated that. So far, it's been Jordan and Alex. Have been so awesome to work with, but, like, so at the end of that two weeks, if we're not done building, is that, like, okay, we're paying for additional credits or we're extending that two week period, or what does that look like? Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a great question. So what we do with a lot of customers is we can do a two week trial. We could also look at, let's say, a week and a half in or close to that two week marker. We could also say, hey, What path do we want to take at that point? And one thing that we could do is like, okay, do you feel like you need more confidence? And that's going to be a three month period of time. I mean, let's also say there's times where customers say, hey, like, we've tried this and like, we don't even want to go. To a paid pilot. Right? Let's not even do that. Like, we're kind of dqing you for these reasons. This is the feedback that we provide you that might actually be a better experience for everybody as well. We want to FlowBuilder sure that we give you guys the experience that makes the most sense so that that's one thing we could do is like, hey, we could run it for two weeks. Let's, let's, you know, think about that one use case. Maybe Jordan can still provide the support that we've had so far. And we are really confident in being able to get use cases up and live much. Quicker than almost any other platform out there. Right. And especially on citizen development like we have that much conviction, in my view, for the citizen development portion. Even with a two week period of time where people can get workflows up and running. Yeah. You know, compared to other platforms that are out there. So that's one thing that we could do. And within that two week period, of course, like, we're always around to be like, okay. What's the next step? Do we actually feel like there's enough confidence within this time to just move on to a full partnership? Are we moving over to a pilot next? What are the gaps that we need to FlowBuilder up? And that. That could also be a Francis conversation. We just have then to decide. My concern is like we, you know, go through like six discussions on the pilot, the criteria and then we just like lose momentum and maybe you don't get signal is the other thing I want to like reduce for your team. And there still is that risk on your end of like still putting cash up front. Maybe a lot of cash upfront for. For a pilot, even where you you might get signal within a short amount of time. Okay? I mean, that. That sounds fine to me. I don't know. David, do you have any reactions? Yep, fine.  \nMe: So then super tactically in terms of next steps, it sounds like, hey, we're going to do a two week trial. Jordan James continue to work with you, Sarah to build out that use case. I guess the one thing I would want to FlowBuilder sure we can nail down is what would a like a workshop or a office hours of getting other people on board look like? Because I think, if I'm understanding correctly, I think that's actually a really important piece of this criteria, like, how easy is it for someone to actually use. How easy is someone get up their first agent, you know, in sort of one sitting? Is that something that we could try to put on the calendar for the next couple of weeks, or would there not be capacity in the team to do something like that?  \nThem: No, I think. I think David, maybe our IT extended LT meeting could be a good forum for that. Like, if we come into it, maybe we can do some. I can, I can ask folks beforehand, like, what are some of the pain points? So we can give the AutomateFlow team a little bit more to go off of to be like, targeted in that time. And then we can walk through, like, specifically. Okay. Like Kirby says, I have a thousand emails and I need to sort them by priority. Like, what would setting up that automation look like in AutomateFlow? You know, people can bring their own use cases and kind of get hands on, and we can do, like, I think Alex and Jordan, if we can do some of the legwork of, like, making sure that everyone's set up with an account beforehand and has, like, we figured out, like, whatever outlook connector issues and all that, that'll set us up for success. To have a good session, I think we could probably ask for, you know, 45 minutes to an hour. I can ask our team if we can do that in the next instance, which should be, I think, in the next couple of weeks. Yeah, I think that's a great forum, Sarah.  \nMe: Cool. That sounds like. That sounds like a plan. I'll follow up with the specific, specific details of what we discussed here, and then, Sarah, I'll work with you on logistics around getting that scheduled, and then you, me and Jordan can work on getting sort of this first use case up and running in the next couple. Weeks.  \nThem: That sounds great.  \nMe: Okay, thanks.  \nThem: In my view here too, on the, like, on the work that we're doing now is this work James happen now or later, right? Like, it James always happen. And that's what I'm also trying to push is like, we want to FlowBuilder sure that you guys can get to production in some. Some workflows. As quickly as possible on Zap. And I think we want to show that, and I feel pretty confident in being able to show some of that stuff. I'll also say, like, Jordan and Jordan's boss might be like, gosh, like, this is, like, rough. Like, we can do this. Yes. Like, I'm a little worried about the investments that we put in, but we could definitely talk about, like, what that looks like, Jordan. But, yeah, I wanted to see, like, what. What do you need, Jordan? I know maybe is what I'm hearing is let's. Let's do that invoicing workflow that you have, right? Now, we could use that as kind of like our, like our hallmark, one that we have. I'm even open to opening it up to a citizen development team. I know you're having this. It. This meeting with IT Leadership. David. Maybe the question for you is, like, would we be open for something like that, where we say, hey, we'll give you access to, you know, folks that you want. If you need things locked down, like, you can actually do that, we can give you some tools to get that started and maybe give it to limited folks. And get that started. I want to prove like we're getting some sense of development going and getting this major workflow going. Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good. And that's all part of the evaluation process, right? How you guys handle the security piece of it? Because I think that's a tricky piece. Got it. And I don't know, David, if. If like our for citizen development, we probably want to limit it to one function and probably a more savvy function at that. So I'm thinking either it or maybe even PI could be good if they want to play around with it. What do you think? Yeah, I think. I think it's fine. I think that if there's an opportunity with. Even with finance, I think at the end of the day, it's how careful we are with the setup. In fact, I think that if you start with a savvy group like it for the system development piece of it, It might not be as effective. Right, versus the finance team. Sorry.  \nMe: Oh, you just don't get the full signal. Because if someone's already, like, technical savvy, it's like, it doesn't really tell you how hard it is for someone that new to come up the curve.  \nThem: Yeah. That's fair. And I think that that that's a better evaluation process. But the key here is. We FlowBuilder sure that we're locking things right in the set of piece. Yeah. Yeah, gotcha. Or maybe even legal, I guess. I guess. Yeah. Well, we can talk about it more. I think maybe a group that has, like, high appetite and, you know, ideas already for things that they want to do but are a little less. Technically savvy. That's a good point. As a better marker, But I feel like finance is so far behind on just even having ideas or having the appetite, so maybe Legal is a better group. Yeah, fair enough. One good option, too, David, is the folks that I'm just hearing about. Like, just because I've heard about some of the workflows in Microsoft that's The other one is you could actually look at the champions in your business that are already doing some workflows on Microsoft or those tools to say, hey, If you are a person that's using this right now, look at AutomateFlow. See what the difference in these platforms are and what you can achieve. And that could be something that. So how we also see the product is even if it is citizen development, what you see is there are these champions in each of these. Orgs that really do a lot of the building and love doing that. And, you know, versus, like, more of a TeamChat tool, right, where it's like everybody's forced to use it. You know, we see a little bit of differences there. Maybe Jordan, over to you in terms of, like, what do you need to FlowBuilder this successful? Or, I mean, even happy to hear, like, some of the challenges you might also see. I think, like, first, I think I probably am going to infer is, you know, two weeks might be a short time on that invoicing part. But just wanted to see what we can do to help you and FlowBuilder sure we can drive value. Yeah. I think the first thing I'm excited to jump into it. I think it's very feasible to get it done in two weeks. I think two, two of the things really is the biggest points of friction whenever we start. And a lot of stuff we cover in onboarding. It says the app connections. Right. I mean Sarah, we saw this with trying to connect Outlook. We got a requested and wait for it to approve it. So if we the more pre work we can do to get like let's map out the process and then here the apps we're going to use and let's just go and get those connections. Knocked out, and then we can FlowBuilder the most use of our time building together and so that we can see that really quickly. So I know you're meeting with the finance team on Monday to kind of map out that whole workflow. Right. How is it done today? So that having that map and the more detail we. Have the. The better and the faster it'll go to say, like, how can we automate? Where should we automate? And that James really be the biggest thing for. For us going into this period to say, like, we know how this works kind of end to end, and we know what we should do to properly automate. This, and then we can build those connections along the way. That'd be super helpful.  \nMe: Sarah, if you don't mind, would. Would it be okay for us to eventually join that finance meeting, even if just, like, a silent observers? I think it would be helpful to, like, see, like, sort of hear from the horse's mouth what they're discussing.  \nThem: Yeah. Sure.  \nMe: What? What time is that?  \nThem: So I have a kickoff call with them today, and then I was going to schedule a second follow up meeting next week. That one's not on the books yet, but I think that's probably the right one to add you guys to because I think today the conversation James just be like, hey, let's land. On the goals, like, let me, you know, understand current state in a lot of detail and talk about roles and responsibilities and next steps. And then that second meeting, we can, like, really deep dive into the design for the second one. So I'll. I'll FlowBuilder sure I invite you to that.  \nMe: Sounds good. Thank you.  \nThem: All right. I think I'm starting to see a little bit of a plan forming, so maybe a steps like we could. Alex, I'm happy to work with you on it, but we could do an enterprise trial and provide it for their team. There is task limits, but then we could figure that out as we go. And David. Sarah, I think you guys are going to help us out with, you know, access, getting connected and so forth. Well, we could also do is. I think the best solution is maybe we book something not at the end of next week, but maybe like Wednesday or a little earlier, and we could just start talking about, okay, like. Where are we moving with this discussion? So sometimes it could be. No. Like, I don't know what the conversations James be after this call, but it might just be now. Like, let's just move to a paid pilot. Let's just do that. If that is, like, where we're moving, happy to do so. If we're comfortable with this, we want to go at the pace that that makes the most sense for you guys. So maybe we just do a check in in that way just so we could. Yeah. Just figure out, like, if the next steps are pilot. If the next steps are. Okay, we're trending. Well, let's just continue for another week and then we could look at a full rollout. Does that seem right in terms of sequencing or thing maybe for you? Like, if you feel like that sequencing is very different to how you would normally purchase or go through the process, No, it sounds good to me. It worked. Maybe a question for you. David, is as we're building out this invoice assistant use case, I know the assumption has been, like, you know, I'll drive it with Jordan. Is there anyone else on your team that we should kind of include in that build process? Because I'm recognizing that, like, I think. The biggest, one of the biggest things here is like your whole team is very familiar with working in Workado. And I think actually to get the best head to head comparison, maybe it is someone like Brian, who has been like the day in, day out builder, who should also see the process. Yeah, I think so. I think it'd be really helpful to bring in Brian. And I can tag along, too, specifically when we get to some decision points on the connectivity with the Enterprise systems, specifically on the security piece. I love to learn about that. Yeah, that would be perfect. Because, like, my biggest question mark is, James we be able to do, like, writing and uploading into Coopa through this, and James those connections work smoothly? Which, to be honest, I feel like might be a little bit outside of the AutomateFlow team's control. And I know you've worked a ton in, so I think that would be good to have you along. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think so. Right. This gives us a chance to just see how AutomateFlow, I guess, interfaces with the security structure that is already in these applications. And how James they leverage it? Okay, cool.  \nMe: Okay. So I guess just super tap that we would could we, as a preliminary, maybe put time for 9am Eastern on Wednesday as a check in for us to follow up? That that'll be the 20th of next week. That'll hopefully give Jordan and Sarah a chance to start thinking about the connections and like, what this flow actually looks like. And then I guess depending on when we think the call with the finance team is going to be, because it might be worthwhile to have this conversation after that. One.  \nThem: Yeah, I would say let's Wednesday. I can't do 9am so if we could do Thursday or Friday, that's probably ideal. Let me.  \nMe: I vote Thursday then. Just because. Just because if we do it Friday, then there's, like, no. No chance to do anything after that meeting, basically. So let's. Let's plan to connect next Thursday morning, and I'll send the invite, and I assume this James just be like, Sarah thing, and then you guys. Can forward it to the other IT person on your team that you mentioned.  \nThem: Yep. Sure.  \nMe: That sounds good. Big size. I'll send follow up details here. Appreciate you guys taking the time today and hope you have a good weekend.  \nThem: Thank you so much. You guys. Nice to meet you. Have a good.  \nMe: Bye. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/9e0e4769-0ac6-4ae6-9df6-f505fca6379e](https://example.com/...

We probably won't have a time to answer everyone's questions then in that 30 minutes, but there's a couple of key points we want to FlowBuilder sure we hit while we have the full group. So let me just go ahead and jump in since we know we're short. On time. So kind of today, there's three goals that I'm kind of want to FlowBuilder sure we get through one falling up on our last conversation. And I know that there's been some internal conversations in terms of path forward since then, but still want to just share what does a partnership with us look like to help paint that picture of how we help you actually get set up for success. Two. We want to talk about what the path forward looks like. So what is the evaluation criteria that you guys are actually using? How are we thinking about success? What are, like, the metrics you would need to see to be like, hey, we feel really confident that AutomateFlow was going to help us transform our vision. And then finally, we just want to figure out what are the tactical next steps and how do we align on what's going forward? I want to FlowBuilder sure. Is that in line with what you guys want out of this conversation? If we walk out with these three things, are you happy? Do we feel like we have a path forward? Or is there anything else you specifically want to FlowBuilder sure we cover in this time?"

          "text": "It looks like a good list to me. I don't know, Emma, maybe just for like, 30 seconds of context for you, because I know we've had some back and forth on this, but maybe not the full picture. So we had a demo from the AutomateFlow team last week, David, Robert and I, and we've. Been talking about how do we FlowBuilder progress in Q1, but also how do we pick the right platform for the enterprise. Obviously, we've had this vision of maybe in Q2 or Q3 of this year, we want to start bringing other people onto the platform, allow people to develop agents. And so where we landed, the direction that Robert and I are trying to go in as maybe it's worthwhile doing a pilot first before we open it up to the full enterprise so that we really understand what it would take to kind of get up the curve in terms of understanding how to use the tool. And I think it gives us a little bit more time to FlowBuilder sure we understand fully all of the security pieces, too. I love a good pilot approach, so appreciate that. Yeah. Awesome."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Awesome. Okay. So first, I just want to kind of describe the partnership a little bit. Last time you'd asked about what does it look like for you guys to actually partners with going forward? Like we mentioned, we have the TAM hours, we have the essay, helping you with onboarding, we have all these other programs. But what does that actually mean for you guys in practice? So what we wanted to lay out is kind of how we think about this in terms of phases. Where one is we build together. So this is in the initial time period Jordan and Sarah are building side by side to actually capture that sort of 390k of annual value that. Sarah's mapped out from just those two sort of initial use cases. And the goal here is sort of. Have Jordan help accelerate the build while Sarah is learning so that by the end of this period, it's done and working. But there's also a strong institutional knowledge that Sarah has. Then we start to say, okay, now that Sarah's been enabled, how do we think about spreading this more broadly across the org? So Sarah is trained, the TAM is continuing to build more complex things going forward. So if there's, like, another use case that requires lots of coordination across the org, the TAM can, like, FlowBuilder sure those are done for you guys. But then we're also enabling you to do 80 to 90% of the types of tasks that people would use AutomateFlow for. You can build yourself. You can enable your team to build them in a secure way with controls. And then that gets the people on the platform. And then once people are on the platform, it almost becomes a question of, okay, what are. What are people actually prioritizing? What's important to them? And that then drives and informs the path forward. And overall, the value, the sort of goal and what I would say thesis. Statement is we want. We want you to get to a place where you don't need a TAM to support every build, but you always have the strategic guidance to understand what's next. I James pause and like ask for questions, thoughts, reactions from the group in terms of hey, like, based off of this list, do you feel like you would have the support you need to actually enable people? Are there a specific follow up questions that you have tied to this. And I guess maybe like David and Robert in particular, I know you guys had questions around what support looks like. How do we handle spikiness, for example?"
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Again. Going back to what Sarah said, it's important if we can do a pilot. It's a way to test the partnership and the way of working together. I would say I'm confidant that this is okay, this approach is okay for Pilot. And then again, it's the opportunity to fine tune and understand what we need to work if we decide to work on a longer partnership. Long term partnership."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yeah. That's actually might be a good segue. So we had a couple of questions that we wanted to talk through. Like, in terms of how you guys were thinking about the pilot, kind of where we fit into this overall structure. So I know one of the things, I was talking to Sarah, she mentioned that part of what's driving the pilot interest is you feel like you've made software purchase in the past, like, too quickly. Haven't necessarily gotten the value from that that you expected during the buying process. Could you talk to me a bit about, like, a bit about that context in history there?"

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "I'm afraid that any one of us was here when it happened. But we know that we have software at Horizon Ventures today that are not used or not exactly what the best in class that we wouldn't select today. So it was more reference to what we have today. Not our personal history with Horizon Ventures."

          "speaker": "me",

          "text": "I mean, to most didn't purchase a lot of software that we don't use."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "That makes a lot of sense. And I guess, how do you think about the time us versus Workado in your setup? Like, are you in particular if when we're. When we were talking about, like, hey, let's get Sarah up to speed and just get started, we were kind of talking about, hey, us and Ricotta are going to be doing separate things because the things that work Auto is doing would take longer for us to actually get set up. There's some time investment involved in potentially moving those over. Curious if you. Are you guys thinking about that the same way if we're talking about doing pilot before. Moving forward."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Not sure. Question. Yeah, Maybe I can jump in here. So my understanding is, on the workado platform, we have the orchestration piece of it today, and we have a couple of different workflows built out that are working well for our EA team. And then this agentic piece is kind of. They said, go ahead, experiment with our AI. Agent capabilities. But that is something that in the future, unlike the orchestration side of the house, we want to open up to the company more broadly, to say everyone should be able to create their own agents. I think to me, I mean, David, this is probably an enterprise applications question as well, is how do we see it? I don't think we want the agent platform to disrupt what we have on the orchestration side. I could see it working in the long term, where we say we use Work Auto for orchestration and we use AutomateFlow for agents and citizen development. That could be an option. Or we could say maybe it's one platform for both. But I recognize in that second scenario there would be rework. That's required with rebuilding what we have on the existing orchestration side, so that's probably not ideal, unless we feel like there are gaps. Yeah, I agree with that. Sarah David can comment as well, but has been the middleware for Horizon Ventures for several years. Now at the teams are very happy with Warcato as a middleware. And so now we are at this stage where it's not only the traditional middleware, it's AI that we need to orchestrator. This is where we need to understand what is the best solution for us. In terms of orchestration or for AI."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Gotcha."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Hey everybody. If. If you don't mind me jumping in. So I think we didn't do intros. My name is Kyungho. We're also here with Jordan. So all of us on the AutomateFlow team, really excited to be here. I run our mid market team, our SMB teams, our sales. Assist teams and joined AutomateFlow about four years ago. We didn't have a sales team back then, so it's just two people really excited to see our growth and excited to hear about this from Alex. And he pulled me in recently just in terms of the conversation that you know where the conversation was going. Here. What's interesting, maybe this is for David. That I'd love to understand is our whole market positioning actually is orchestration platform is where AutomateFlow positions ourselves in the market today. What I'm hearing is Workado is not one of these purchases where, hey, we're just not getting the usage. Out of it. I feel what I'm hearing is, like, you guys are actually getting really good value out of it. Now that you're thinking about bringing AutomateFlow into the platform, I'd love to hear, like, where the differences are. So we also say, like, everybody's perception of a product is probably three, four years behind, right? So even when I think about TeamChat or any of the products we use, I think about the capabilities of three, four years ago. And so AutomateFlow has done a lot of work to now work with a lot of enterprise. Right. So when you think about very large enterprises using us as an orchestration layer, I'm interested in David or Sarah. How do you think about now in this new stage? Let's say AutomateFlow gets online. How do you think about what goes to work Auto and what goes to AutomateFlow? I don't. Know if it's a cost thing, a use thing. Let's say we like, play in the same field and I'll go through the intricacies and we'll be very upfront about it, but would love to hear more. The driving force behind our exploration of AutomateFlow was never to be a replacement for what David and team have already built in Mercado. That's working well to Robert's point, around the middleware and the orchestration workflows that are already built. There's no part of this conversation that's not working well today, and we need to replace that. I think our driving force was wanting to pick an agent building platform for the rest of the organization that's beyond it and thinking about our AI roadmap and that is new functionality that the Work Auto team has been telling us they have. And we were trying to compare a like solution on the AutomateFlow. Side. So that, like, AI piece of it is really what's driving the exploration. And I think the decision is, you know, on the orchestration side, given that both platforms also do that. Right. Like, what's the right choice there? I feel less. You know, I think saying that's more your team's decision. Than mine. Yeah, and I think I James add to that. I think optionality is really, you know, how we're approaching this. This is the whole agentic movement and all that. It's fairly new. And we went with WADO because it's a middleware that we already have a relationship with. And I think bringing in AutomateFlow would give us just a. Broader view of what the capabilities are, the usability and how it fits our company. So, yeah, I think that. I think I can say we're not locked into Wacato. Like if you if that. As if AutomateFlow offers moisture line solution. Let's talk even on the orchestration side. Yeah. Just to echo what David said, this market is evolving so fast. The market, the orchestration market. We need to stay very agile on this and understand what is the best solution for the future for Horizon Ventures. So, again, let's try, let's pilot it, and we'll be able to see what is the robust. Interest. No, I think that's a. I think that's a great place to start the conversation and I think framing wise really important. I'm going to get to the pilot question. I just have one more to go. But on the discussion around, you know, having both platforms on at the same time, I just wanted to understand David. My understand a lot of times with Workado is they're built off recipes, Right. And so you probably have some kind of commercial structure that's, hey, these are top five, these are top ten. And, you know, they're really based off these use cases being X amount and really, you know, driving that all the way start to end and building those workflows. Is that the type of, like, structure that you have with Workado? I just want to FlowBuilder sure we're not just adding something that we honestly could also see, like, hey, just go with work, Auto. This might actually be a better fit for you, but. But we want to FlowBuilder sure that we get that upfront before we even go into a pilot conversation, even if it is. Yeah, that's right, Kyung. That's the setup that we have. Yeah. So one of the differences probably that you've seen with work Auto and AutomateFlow is, I mean, we've always done much better, probably, and that citizen development portion of the business and where that's also helped most of the time, and I think I'm hearing from Sarah is we have, like, three workflows. Three. Three or four use cases that are pretty high priority. I think we've probably found really good ROI in them. I think I heard numbers like 250k in R Y. Just with one use case that we have, you can get those up and running very quickly on AutomateFlow and then test and iterate, Right? So being able to get those, we don't charge per, like recipe equivalents, we actually charge per outcomes. Right? So actions that we run on those platforms, which sometimes in terms of work auto commercial structure is a little different. I never recommend moving something from AutomateFlow over to work auto. And they probably won't either. But I also know some people have started, like, what they're using AutomateFlow for is getting that iteration really quickly and saying, okay, now do we feel like we actually move that over to Workado as a recipe in the future where it's a different commercial structure that you're building. I don't know if you're thinking about it in that way. If it's like, no, we haven't even thought about that, that's totally fine, but I just wanted to get a lay of the land. So as you open the door, it's a Vitaly, but definitely the economic aspect would be a large part of the decision making. So we'll have to speak about this part first. We need to see if it works for us. And then, of course, the economic value James be a huge part of the decision as well. And I think, you know, in Q3, Q4 this year, like, I could see if we did adopt AutomateFlow form an enterprise point of view. Some of the first use cases that we probably have people working on from a citizen development standpoint is like, okay, read my inbox, give me the reminders of what's coming up. Or my right, like more of those types rather than a, hey, let's get our netsuite systems to talk to each other, which is more of what we've been working on on the, you know, we're caught at orchestration side is connectivity between the apps. And so I think the way that you described it with like citizen development versus very business critical workflows that are about app to app connectivity and orchestration are right now like in my mind, kind of two buckets of things. And that second bucket. Let's continue the conversation on. But our primary driver for I think, wanting to explore AutomateFlow is more of that. That first bucket. Yeah. And I don't want to speak on behalf of. We don't want anyone to be able to build automatic update of Netflix or whatever system. So, yes, we need to be very clear also in the security and what is feasible, what is not feasible. For the jr users. And also we better myself, thanks. I said. Couldn't have said it better myself. We have a lot of people here who want to innovate and try things, which were very pro doing with the proper guardrails in place. But we need to FlowBuilder sure that AutomateFlow offers us the necessary security controls to monitor and potentially enforce behavior in a certain way. And on the citizen side, we need to understand also, because here it's not versus work at all, it's maybe versus Microsoft. For instance, what you demonstrated last week, I did the same. I had done the same before with Microsoft. So we need also to understand where AutomateFlow brings value compared to the solution that we have already. And I'd assume that that's like a Power Automate. A workflow. Yes, Microsoft workflow. Okay. Microsoft work for us. Yeah. Yeah. I think these are all really great points and I hear, like, where the conversation is going on pilots. Part of the reason I got on the call is for two reasons. One is just to kind of talk about how we run pilots. What, you know, when we run pilots and why we usually don't run pilots is actually the last part. So I just want to be clear there. So part of why we don't run a pilot is for two reasons. I hear you on, you know, a lot of the citizen development concerns that you have. Let's say we solve all of that through our security review. Like, you'll see allowed apps, you'll see all those features that we have. Like, we wouldn't have an enterprise product. Without that. So let's say those are table stakes that we could roll out into the team. You can even have approvals, right? So through a JIRA ticket, you could say, hey, I want access to more apps. It's more of a case by case. We can decide how we build that out. Part of the reason why we don't do a pilot, especially for a product like AutomateFlow, is because I think we lose the citizen development model. If we go a pilot model. So what that means is you have a pilot for three months and then you're launching and you're actually pushing back all of your citizen development because we actually don't really onboard you until after that three month period of time. So I think that's like the first concern that I have is when we're doing a rollout, we want to FlowBuilder sure that we're doing a full rollout where we're connecting to all of your systems, because that's also another thing where, I mean, it does open us us to more risk. That's why we don't do the onboarding initially is because if you're connecting to all your apps, it's going to take us a lot of time. But you know, if you're not doing a whole rollout with the company because, you know, if it's TeamChat or Microsoft, you probably are not doing a pilot and then deciding if you're continuing after three months. So that's, that's one of the big things. So maybe. So I'm trying to figure out, like, ROI in this conversation, and so we can even just hop into commercials next if we wanted to. But maybe the question for I'm trying to figure out is we have a use case that we have that Sarah, you've been working with Jordan. Like, how's. Like, where are we on that use case? Alex gave me a little bit of a heads up, but what I'm trying to figure out is, do we even have enough ROI we're there with the use case, enough to actually prove, like, hey, we have all the connections. We can actually have this. Workflow go live and what kind of assurances we can give your team for a full rollout, you know, if we need to figure out a commercial structure that, you know, figures out an opt out. I mean, we can talk about those things later, but we usually do not go for pilots, and that's why I wanted to join the conversation for that, so maybe Sarah, I'll pass it to you and Jordan of how the workflow and the initial workflow has been going and if we're already essentially there, if we have more time. Yeah, maybe just to explain and I, you know, I appreciate your point of view on, you know, you guys not typically doing pilots. I think for me, especially because it's meant to be a citizen development platform, we need to validate and understand what it James take for people to get up the curve. Like, I can't sit here and confidently say, like, everyone across Horizon Ventures James be able to use this and we should invest, you know, six months enrolling this out across the entire organization if I haven't, like, used it and felt confident that, like, you know, a. We can, we can cover both types of use cases, right? Use case one. Is like, help me automate my calendar, more of the everyday use cases, and then two from a roadmap point of view, some of the quick win use cases we have on there that we'll want to continue building out from an AI perspective in the next couple of months. And so, you know, the use case that Jordan and I are working on for invoice automation. That one has a solid ROI story to it. I think, you know, we want to see by the end of Q1. I'm confident it's possible with AutomateFlow, we want to see the quality of the output that I think James give us a good proxy. For one, how long did it take for us to really understand and learn how to use the platform? And what was that experience like as a proxy for how the rest of the organization James receive it. And, you know, two, can we also build more technically complex workflows that actually drive that ROI so that we have a solid ROI story to go to senior leadership with and, you know, to put in front of Robert and say yes with AutomateFlow, we're confident that all of these different business use cases are possible in addition to citizen development. And that's why we should invest in AutomateFlow. And just to add on. Sorry. Just to add on to that. I know Sarah shared with you guys the UK on the invoice processing is do you guys have a recommendation in terms of any agentic solutions that you have pre built where it showcases the citizen development path that we want to go right out of the gate? So maybe we can do that in parallel on the use case that we propose. And also we could be the pilot of those pre built ones that is much more straightforward and doesn't require workflow, additional workflow mapping that Jordan is working on. Again. Coming back to the box. Number one on your slider. We don't want to FlowBuilder a decision with AutomateFlow before we know that it's the good solution for us. We are motivated, very motivated, to test and to see if it can be the right solution. But we want Rush to. To FlowBuilder an agreement for a full rollout if we don't know. If we are not convinced that it's the right solution for us. Yeah, and I think that's totally fair. One of the things I'm just. Like, considering right now. I know we have four minutes, so I know we'll speed through a couple of the next parts pretty quickly, but one of the things we could do is we could even do a trial. So usually what we do is like, we do like a two week period of a full trial. You guys can. Get into the platform thing, as you said, we have a lot of those, like, great agentic, you know, products that we have internally and templates that we have internally where you can even just see, hey, what happens when big ones that we have is we have like a candidate fraud flag. So on the people side, candidate fraud flag. We have retention risk. You know, builders. A lot of these different things that we have. We're so horizontal. That's the beauty of AutomateFlow. And also what's tough, right? In these situations, if you have things that feel very clear, I think, Sarah, you add ones on calendar and so forth is something. That we could go ahead and drive. With maybe a few minutes left. I'm debating going back and forth on this. But Alex, maybe we could go to the next slide, which is really on what are commercial structure was going to be if it was not a pilot. And this is essentially all we have right now. I heard about the change. I think it was a day ago, so hopefully it doesn't show up. Like, we're not prepared. We just usually don't pipeline or pilots in the same way. But this is usually what the partnership would be. The reason I also thought this was really important to bring up right now is because there is. There is also an opportunity that we're saying, hey, this is not in the budget. Like, when you're looking at an orchestration platform, how you're looking to build. So this is the platform that we have right now, or it might even behave for citizen development. Like, we have this budget. We could go ahead and drive this budget today. So I wanted to get like, while everybody's here, before we move to the next step, this is what our structure would look like. The pilot structure would look very different. We usually front load a lot of the cost, and there is a premium that we go ahead and add into a pilot that would increase this annual investment that you put in that's usually where I also say it's maybe not a good fit if we could rather just push the deal back a couple weeks and you can actually, let's say we get the use case up in live, or maybe we go ahead and show those citizen development portions and like not go through a pilot. So wanted to get reactions before. Maybe. I think Robert and I think Emma had to hop, but maybe we get some feedback on this. Again. I have one minute, so I have to be very brief. But we won't move unless we can pull ourselves. We won't pay AutomateFlow even before we can prove ourselves that. That it can be a good ocean for us. So I'm open to discussions on the best way to do it, but the goal is. We can call it Pork Pilot, whatever we need. To be able to test before we move forward. I need to go, but we can continue. This discussion as another time. Maybe Sarah and David have a few more minutes to discuss with you. But to test."

Talking around the structure of the pilot just to give you a sense of, like, where we're going. What I'm hoping to lay out effectively is, like, get to a rubric around, like, hey, here are the specific criteria we want to judge. I James work with Thing and Sarah on, like, the specifics of this. But just so you know, we are thinking for it around, like, what does this pilot actually look like in practice? And that's kind of what we'll focus on over the next bit of the section."

        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Okay, thanks. Matt. Yeah, maybe. Maybe just a quick reaction, like, I think option wise, it sounds like we could do either the two week trial, which I'm interested in understanding. Would that just look like, hey, you guys have turned on the, like, Enterprise trial, and we go in and play with it and there's, like, minimal support from your team or whether it's still, like, I would get some hands on, you know, time from Jordan and others. That sounds like maybe option one is option two. Is like a more structured three month pilot. And then option three is like going in right away on the total annual investment, which it doesn't sound like Robert is interested in. So I think. I think it sounds like we're playing between options one and two. But let me know, am I interpreting that correctly? And then what would the primary distinction be between those two options? Yeah. I think for us, we want to FlowBuilder up the gap for you, whichever way that that makes sense. So in terms of, like, our support with Jordan, our support with other teams, like, that support James continue going on. So that. That's something that we want to. We want to FlowBuilder clear up front. Maybe the question for me is pilot. Whenever we use that word, it is a paid pilot. So we don't offer a. Not paid pilot. Would Robert? It was one of the questions I was thinking about asking before he hopped. But is that an option? I don't know how like David. Maybe you have a better understanding. Of this, if that's something that you guys have tried before, or if he's like, we don't want to do any payments, like, we could just go the trial route, right? Like, it just makes that decision easier. So I didn't ask that question, but David or Sarah, I don't know if. You have context on. Like, if I know pilots, some people use that as a free trial word, and sometimes they use it as a like, I don't want to put any, like, money down on a product before. So I and I would be curious David you you've worked with Robert for longer, but I think it probably depends on the scope that we're talking about. A bit like if, if doing a paid pilot is going to get more build support for me because I am a one person team and, you know, don't don't have a lot of resources behind me. I do think that's a conversation Robert would be willing to have, like, if it's going to help us get to, you know, kind of guarantee Q1 good outcome that we read back to the rest of our leadership team. Like, I, you know, I don't think that's out of the question at all. Versus if it were completely free. If that means, like, we wouldn't really get a lot of support, we can have that conversation. It's like, what the specifics look like. I don't think the door is closed for a paid pilot. It's just we don't want to sign up for any sort of annual contract or multi year contract without having done that eval. Yeah, I agree. Okay, that's, that's helpful. Part of why I also mentioned that is for pilots, we have to be very clear on our, like, we have to go through, like, multiple calls, and it's like, this is, like, what we need to hit because we want to FlowBuilder sure that, like, the customer, like, just as a risk perspective. We need to FlowBuilder sure the customer doesn't back out and just say, like, great. That's built great. And then you just say, like, all right, I'm going to take that over to work auto and be like, can you guys build us in a recipe? Like, it's risks that we're obviously just being in an open market like we are. We are open to, but that's where a pilot does get very complicated. And we'll ask for multiple checkpoints all the way up the ladder. So we'll have multiple of these discussions just to FlowBuilder sure that we're hitting all our metrics. So sometimes that's why we would rather front load some of the support. So, Sarah, when you talk about a little bit of handholding, Jordan can definitely help out. Like, how do we go ahead and give you support for these use cases to go live? So maybe the conversation changes to so. So that's why I also think it's cleaner to say, like, let's do a free trial. One of the concerns I heard is, like, not connecting to. To your platforms. We could have a full enterprise trial. You know, we can lock down your account, maybe have you, maybe, like, two other people have access. We do need to work with. It. And so, David, you know, that might be something where you decide, like, oh, do I need. Do I want to put that investment? We also like that better to say, we want you to put the investment of having it go through all that work, even without an agreement. But it's something that we could do to say, hey, we could do like a two week run to go into a full partnership. If we proved out, let's say, your first use case, if we proved out a couple of those citizen development portions, how do we actually get to that minimum Viable, like product for your team is something that we could consider that might even be. Cleaner for, for the rest of the group. So hopefully that makes sense in terms of like it's not just a back out of a pilot, but I'd rather push something like that to just give you guys confidence, not have money exchange. But really, hopefully we just drive value and get to a full deal. Yeah. Let me just be really candid, though. When we set out on this, as you know, we have the Wacado platform, the use cases that we have. I think that we can easily just use Wakado for all of it. I think that this engagement here is really giving AutomateFlow a chance to prove what you guys have, you know, and the concept that you brought up earlier about leveraging the AutomateFlow resources and then moving to a cutoff, that is not the intention at all. Like, we have the resources in Wacado to do all of that. We're really just taking a second look at another option. And then with the potential of picking the best one and moving forward. And to Robert's point, you know, we don't know much about AutomateFlow. What you guys can do. Bukhara is a known product to us. So I really, you know, from my standpoint, that's the lens that I'm looking through. Yeah. And I think if I had to kind of get tactical on, like, what are, what are we really looking for and what are some of those success criteria? There's one part of it on the citizen development side, which is can we do sessions with our IT leadership team or other folks across the enterprise executives to show them. Like, here's how you could use AutomateFlow platform to FlowBuilder your day to day productivity easier. Here's how you can set up agents, right? Like that kind of. And get the feedback and understand like was it easy for them to use? Did they get value from that or be interested in opening that up? To the entire company as a platform. And then the second outcome is showing that more complex build is possible and understanding, you know, the head to head comparison on how easy was that more complex workflow to build from a central IT point of view, Where we able to really get like, a robust, robust workflow going that we feel like, gave us, like, the quality of output that we wanted. And what was that experience of building that versus, you know, what the build experience would have been like in ricotta? Right. So whichever structure, I think, helps us get to that endpoint. On evaluation, and whether we structure that as a free trial or pilot or, you know, paid or not, like, you guys, let me know what's easiest on. On your end and what you know, can help us get there. But I wouldn't want to be in this scenario where, you know, we're just saying, like, all right. You guys play around with it for two weeks. Because I feel like I probably would not be able to represent AutomateFlow in the best light to the rest of the organization and actually get that experience, because I know, like, from playing around with it initially, that there are things that I'm missing and that I don't know how to do, and I wouldn't be able to effectively train others on. Yeah, I think both of them. First of all, David, really appreciate you being candid. That's what we're here for. To also be like. We're trying to, like, figure out risk on our side and the same thing on your team. So I really appreciate bringing that up. I would also be lying if I wasn't saying like, hey, I've also been in a lot of these work auto like discussions where I think you've had a great experience. I've also heard the opposite, which is like, hey, we're 10 months in and it's like, it is a lot more of a technical product. We're having just a hard time shipping things out with that team, is what we've heard. Like, we want to win, right? Like, as an orchestration layer is what we want to win. That's part of our goal, too, in the long run, is what we want to do. So hopefully we prove ourselves is the goal. I want to just FlowBuilder sure that we drive confidence, I think for your team. I know I'm driving this question back to you again, but would like a two week period where, I mean, you have Jordan support. We can even get a external TeamChat channel going. I don't know if you're a TeamChat TeamChat shop or not."

        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Okay, great. Like, that could be somewhere where we continue providing support. We could even open up Citizen Development, if you would like. So that's something that we do with a lot of our customers, is they just go, we're going to open this up and actually, like, drive Citizen Development, let's say on the marketing. Team or on the HR team and drive it in one of those teams and, like, get enough signal for your team. Because again, like, as I said before, like, that onboarding part is missed a little bit when we go through a pilot, because essentially the experience is going to be very similar to what you get in a two week period. Right. Because we're just going to say these are the success criteria over three months or whatever time period it might be. And some people activate a lot quicker if we ever go into that with, with very large enterprises. But I'm almost trying to think of a way that just gives you confidence where we say, we'll give you the platform. Maybe we even do a single boot camp. So we have, like, an AI. We have AI engineers. We have folks that can run a boot camp. Up to, like, nine folks on your team, get that up and running. And if that's a timeline you want to drive, but or David. I don't know if this is something where you're like, I want to look at reliability over three months. I want to look at, you know, what adoption looks like over three months, and, like, we're willing to pay for that. I'm just trying to get signal on either one, which, again, we're happy to drive whatever works best for you, but. Yeah. Question back to you guys. I think that if we are doing a three month pilot. I think all of it. All those are in play in terms of our evaluation process, which is the provider to go forward with. So we started out the year with a set of business cases that we want to apply a genetic solution to. And so with that list, we've carved out a use case. And in fact, it's the simplest use case, right, that we have. And intend to explore AutomateFlow with as a pilot. So at the same time we have other use cases, some more complex ones going on with Waddle. And this agentic setup that we have with Wacado is also very new to us. And this is a good opportunity when we're starting out just to see what options we have. We don't have a long term setup with Wacoto and, yeah. With this dispositions us to really. Evaluate this in a fair manner. And then FlowBuilder a decision that's best for a company. I think with the two week period. So maybe just questions for you on how that would work. So say we get to the end of the two weeks and we're not done building this invoice assistant. Which maybe, maybe this is because I'm naive and haven't, like, I'm not a AutomateFlow. Power user, but I question a little bit the possibility of us actually getting, like, a high quality MVP up and running in two weeks. Just knowing that there's a bit of a learning curve for me, even with Jordan support. And I've, like, really appreciated that. So far, it's been Jordan and Alex. Have been so awesome to work with, but, like, so at the end of that two weeks, if we're not done building, is that, like, okay, we're paying for additional credits or we're extending that two week period, or what does that look like? Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a great question. So what we do with a lot of customers is we can do a two week trial. We could also look at, let's say, a week and a half in or close to that two week marker. We could also say, hey, What path do we want to take at that point? And one thing that we could do is like, okay, do you feel like you need more confidence? And that's going to be a three month period of time. I mean, let's also say there's times where customers say, hey, like, we've tried this and like, we don't even want to go. To a paid pilot. Right? Let's not even do that. Like, we're kind of dqing you for these reasons. This is the feedback that we provide you that might actually be a better experience for everybody as well. We want to FlowBuilder sure that we give you guys the experience that makes the most sense so that that's one thing we could do is like, hey, we could run it for two weeks. Let's, let's, you know, think about that one use case. Maybe Jordan can still provide the support that we've had so far. And we are really confident in being able to get use cases up and live much. Quicker than almost any other platform out there. Right. And especially on citizen development like we have that much conviction, in my view, for the citizen development portion. Even with a two week period of time where people can get workflows up and running. Yeah. You know, compared to other platforms that are out there. So that's one thing that we could do. And within that two week period, of course, like, we're always around to be like, okay. What's the next step? Do we actually feel like there's enough confidence within this time to just move on to a full partnership? Are we moving over to a pilot next? What are the gaps that we need to FlowBuilder up? And that. That could also be a Francis conversation. We just have then to decide. My concern is like we, you know, go through like six discussions on the pilot, the criteria and then we just like lose momentum and maybe you don't get signal is the other thing I want to like reduce for your team. And there still is that risk on your end of like still putting cash up front. Maybe a lot of cash upfront for. For a pilot, even where you you might get signal within a short amount of time. Okay? I mean, that. That sounds fine to me. I don't know. David, do you have any reactions? Yep, fine."

I guess the one thing I would want to FlowBuilder sure we can nail down is what would a like a workshop or a office hours of getting other people on board look like? Because I think, if I'm understanding correctly, I think that's actually a really important piece of this criteria, like, how easy is it for someone to actually use. How easy is someone get up their first agent, you know, in sort of one sitting? Is that something that we could try to put on the calendar for the next couple of weeks, or would there not be capacity in the team to do something like that?"

I can, I can ask folks beforehand, like, what are some of the pain points? So we can give the AutomateFlow team a little bit more to go off of to be like, targeted in that time. And then we can walk through, like, specifically. Okay. Like Kirby says, I have a thousand emails and I need to sort them by priority. Like, what would setting up that automation look like in AutomateFlow? You know, people can bring their own use cases and kind of get hands on, and we can do, like, I think Alex and Jordan, if we can do some of the legwork of, like, making sure that everyone's set up with an account beforehand and has, like, we figured out, like, whatever outlook connector issues and all that, that'll set us up for success. To have a good session, I think we could probably ask for, you know, 45 minutes to an hour. I can ask our team if we can do that in the next instance, which should be, I think, in the next couple of weeks. Yeah, I think that's a great forum, Sarah."

And I think we want to show that, and I feel pretty confident in being able to show some of that stuff. I'll also say, like, Jordan and Jordan's boss might be like, gosh, like, this is, like, rough. Like, we can do this. Yes. Like, I'm a little worried about the investments that we put in, but we could definitely talk about, like, what that looks like, Jordan. But, yeah, I wanted to see, like, what. What do you need, Jordan? I know maybe is what I'm hearing is let's. Let's do that invoicing workflow that you have, right? Now, we could use that as kind of like our, like our hallmark, one that we have. I'm even open to opening it up to a citizen development team. I know you're having this. It. This meeting with IT Leadership. David. Maybe the question for you is, like, would we be open for something like that, where we say, hey, we'll give you access to, you know, folks that you want. If you need things locked down, like, you can actually do that, we can give you some tools to get that started and maybe give it to limited folks. And get that started. I want to prove like we're getting some sense of development going and getting this major workflow going. Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good. And that's all part of the evaluation process, right? How you guys handle the security piece of it? Because I think that's a tricky piece. Got it. And I don't know, David, if. If like our for citizen development, we probably want to limit it to one function and probably a more savvy function at that. So I'm thinking either it or maybe even PI could be good if they want to play around with it. What do you think? Yeah, I think. I think it's fine. I think that if there's an opportunity with. Even with finance, I think at the end of the day, it's how careful we are with the setup. In fact, I think that if you start with a savvy group like it for the system development piece of it, It might not be as effective. Right, versus the finance team. Sorry."

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. That's fair. And I think that that that's a better evaluation process. But the key here is. We FlowBuilder sure that we're locking things right in the set of piece. Yeah. Yeah, gotcha. Or maybe even legal, I guess. I guess. Yeah. Well, we can talk about it more. I think maybe a group that has, like, high appetite and, you know, ideas already for things that they want to do but are a little less. Technically savvy. That's a good point. As a better marker, But I feel like finance is so far behind on just even having ideas or having the appetite, so maybe Legal is a better group. Yeah, fair enough. One good option, too, David, is the folks that I'm just hearing about. Like, just because I've heard about some of the workflows in Microsoft that's The other one is you could actually look at the champions in your business that are already doing some workflows on Microsoft or those tools to say, hey, If you are a person that's using this right now, look at AutomateFlow. See what the difference in these platforms are and what you can achieve. And that could be something that. So how we also see the product is even if it is citizen development, what you see is there are these champions in each of these. Orgs that really do a lot of the building and love doing that. And, you know, versus, like, more of a TeamChat tool, right, where it's like everybody's forced to use it. You know, we see a little bit of differences there. Maybe Jordan, over to you in terms of, like, what do you need to FlowBuilder this successful? Or, I mean, even happy to hear, like, some of the challenges you might also see. I think, like, first, I think I probably am going to infer is, you know, two weeks might be a short time on that invoicing part. But just wanted to see what we can do to help you and FlowBuilder sure we can drive value. Yeah. I think the first thing I'm excited to jump into it. I think it's very feasible to get it done in two weeks. I think two, two of the things really is the biggest points of friction whenever we start. And a lot of stuff we cover in onboarding. It says the app connections. Right. I mean Sarah, we saw this with trying to connect Outlook. We got a requested and wait for it to approve it. So if we the more pre work we can do to get like let's map out the process and then here the apps we're going to use and let's just go and get those connections. Knocked out, and then we can FlowBuilder the most use of our time building together and so that we can see that really quickly. So I know you're meeting with the finance team on Monday to kind of map out that whole workflow. Right. How is it done today? So that having that map and the more detail we. Have the. The better and the faster it'll go to say, like, how can we automate? Where should we automate? And that James really be the biggest thing for. For us going into this period to say, like, we know how this works kind of end to end, and we know what we should do to properly automate. This, and then we can build those connections along the way. That'd be super helpful."

On the goals, like, let me, you know, understand current state in a lot of detail and talk about roles and responsibilities and next steps. And then that second meeting, we can, like, really deep dive into the design for the second one. So I'll. I'll FlowBuilder sure I invite you to that."

Alex, I'm happy to work with you on it, but we could do an enterprise trial and provide it for their team. There is task limits, but then we could figure that out as we go. And David. Sarah, I think you guys are going to help us out with, you know, access, getting connected and so forth. Well, we could also do is. I think the best solution is maybe we book something not at the end of next week, but maybe like Wednesday or a little earlier, and we could just start talking about, okay, like. Where are we moving with this discussion? So sometimes it could be. No. Like, I don't know what the conversations James be after this call, but it might just be now. Like, let's just move to a paid pilot. Let's just do that. If that is, like, where we're moving, happy to do so. If we're comfortable with this, we want to go at the pace that that makes the most sense for you guys. So maybe we just do a check in in that way just so we could. Yeah. Just figure out, like, if the next steps are pilot. If the next steps are. Okay, we're trending. Well, let's just continue for another week and then we could look at a full rollout. Does that seem right in terms of sequencing or thing maybe for you? Like, if you feel like that sequencing is very different to how you would normally purchase or go through the process, No, it sounds good to me. It worked. Maybe a question for you. David, is as we're building out this invoice assistant use case, I know the assumption has been, like, you know, I'll drive it with Jordan. Is there anyone else on your team that we should kind of include in that build process? Because I'm recognizing that, like, I think. The biggest, one of the biggest things here is like your whole team is very familiar with working in Workado. And I think actually to get the best head to head comparison, maybe it is someone like Brian, who has been like the day in, day out builder, who should also see the process. Yeah, I think so. I think it'd be really helpful to bring in Brian. And I can tag along, too, specifically when we get to some decision points on the connectivity with the Enterprise systems, specifically on the security piece. I love to learn about that. Yeah, that would be perfect. Because, like, my biggest question mark is, James we be able to do, like, writing and uploading into Coopa through this, and James those connections work smoothly? Which, to be honest, I feel like might be a little bit outside of the AutomateFlow team's control. And I know you've worked a ton in, so I think that would be good to have you along. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think so. Right. This gives us a chance to just see how AutomateFlow, I guess, interfaces with the security structure that is already in these applications. And how James they leverage it? Okay, cool."

That that'll be the 20th of next week. That'll hopefully give Jordan and Sarah a chance to start thinking about the connections and like, what this flow actually looks like.

Hi, David.  \nThem: Hello.  \nMe: How are you doing today?  \nThem: Good. How are you?  \nMe: Doing well. Doing very well. Robert. Good morning.  \nThem: Sorry. Good morning. I was on mute.  \nMe: No worries. Appreciate you guys joining us today.  \nThem: You are doing your meeting with Zoom. I've not used anymore to Zoom. So I had to figure out.  \nMe: Well, glad. Glad it wasn't too much of a lift. This is the group for now, right, Sarah?  \nThem: Yeah, it is. And Alex, I'm happy to kick it off for Robert and David before you dive in. So I know we had the Workada demo on my first day joining Horizon Ventures. I remember there were some concerns about the bring your own model functionality and more broadly, I want to FlowBuilder sure we have a solid long term decision on what sort of a GenTech platform we're going with with a vision of Q1, I think, focusing on the software license optimization and the finance invoice processing bot. But more generally, as we look at the next year or two, thinking about what's the best platform where we could actually open it up to the rest of the business and start to train people on how to create their own agents. So I started the conversation with AutomateFlow team before the holidays, and I gave them some pointers on what our team might be interested in. So hoping we can FlowBuilder a decision pretty quickly coming out of this call.  \nMe: Yeah. Great overview, Sarah. And I guess just before I jump in thing, Robert, before I get into my materials, is there anything you want to FlowBuilder sure we're like, hey, this is a question that's top of mind for me over the next hour. If we could answer this, it would help me feel more confident in a decision.  \nThem: Beside what me described. No. Again, we have a lot of ambition in AI of business processes or business workflows. So we need to FlowBuilder sure we select the best solution that James be able to help us, support us in this ambition. So it's very generic, but this is where we are.  \nMe: Honestly not that generic. You would be surprised how many companies aren't even that far along the process. They're still just, like, giving ChatGPT subscriptions to their team and just like, hey, let's figure it out. So, you guys, I understand feeling, like, Pioneering, like, oh, there's always more to do. But you're actually pretty far ahead of the curve compared.  \nThem: We are beyond that because we deploy ChatGPT when you're at least. And we have a lot of users have a lot of custom GPTs. But we did this part of AI. No, we need, we need to do the automation part, the business process part, and this is where I believe you can help us.  \nMe: To. Absolutely. So I'll go ahead and jump in. I'm going to give just lay a bit of framework, some of this Sarah already covered. And then we'll spend most of our time with Jordan actually walking you through the pool, showing the examples of those two use cases that Sarah laid out, but also talking a bit about how does AutomateFlow work more broadly? What are our security and governance setups? And then finally, we'll talk a bit about what would next steps in, like, a partnership here actually look like? Like, how do we enable you, one, to get these things done today? And also to Sarah's point, you know, maybe later this year, start trading broadly the organ, rolling out some of those initiatives. So just want to level set on the three things that we view as most important based on our conversations so far. 1. Bringing your own model. This is important from like a security governance standpoint. You guys are doing a lot of really cutting edge research across your companies. You don't want that information stored in ChatGPT you don't want it stored used to train future models. And that's something we want to FlowBuilder sure we focus on two speed to value. Like we mentioned, Sarah just coming into this role, we want her to be able to hit the ground running, show real outcomes, and then help build the case for the rest. Of the business going forward. And then last but not least, and this is around coexistence, because we know you do have an existing workado implementation. We're not trying to supplant that or like blow up the work that your IT team is currently doing. This would be additive and focused on these Netu use cases focused on what we call citizen development. Getting people involved. I'll pause here. Does this, like, resonate with you as the things that are most important as you're making this decision?  \nThem: Yes. For me. I don't know David and Sarah, but. Yeah, I agree. And then maybe I guess the only other thing, and we've already spoken a little bit about this, is wanting to pick a platform that is as easy to use as possible. Like, I think, as we think about not Q1, but next year and the year after, what does it look like for somebody who has never built an agent before to do that in the AutomateFlow platform versus workado.  \nMe: Yeah, that's a really great point. Well, Jordan, I think we'll cover some of that during his demo, but honestly, I think that is the biggest differentiator for AutomateFlow compared to the Riccato's innate ends of the world is our ease of use and sort of our DNA as a. No code platform. We're really designed for people who aren't technical, be able to, like, get up to speed. And with the AI capabilities, it just makes it that much easier, so we'll FlowBuilder sure to touch on that as well. And again, he did touch on this, but just wanted to sort of weave in working together for the past month or so. That's she's given us a lot of good context around what's important to you guys. So the one thing I want to flag here is the timeline that we're ideally working towards would be. Hey. A decision in the next week or so so that Sarah could start building with our team by the end of this month. Like I mentioned before, kind of the goal coming out of this is like, hey, we can be generally supportive of this, or like, these are the couple of things that we would need to see to FlowBuilder that call. And from there, I James actually hand this off to Jordan to actually start going into some of the demos themselves and talking about the product.  \nThem: Awesome. Yeah. Excited to meet you guys. David and Robert, solution architect here. And I get to help a lot of customers and prospects just. FlowBuilder their use cases real inside AutomateFlow. So it's fun for me. I love building out of AutomateFlow. And I'll start off with a Before diving into the two use cases that we've been working with Sarah on and just trying to architect and say, how could this work? How could AutomateFlow help with those two? I'd like to do a little AutomateFlow 101. Just orient you guys. Robert or David? Have you guys been in AutomateFlow at all? Is this brand new to you? Brand new to me. Coming back to Sarah's question before. And maybe the bad example. But I tried on a personal level, AutomateFlow, a few months ago, and I gave up. You gave up? What were you trying to do? Do you remember? Yes, I wanted to find a way to automate some tasks in Outlook to create automatically some time slot to resort sometime slots. You didn't get what I wanted. I gave up. Okay. Okay, well, maybe we'll. A little training James get you on your way regardless. But that's good context. Thank you.  \nMe: I don't want to derail. But what I might do, Robert, is we James often do, like, little workshops. Maybe it's like you and a couple of the executive team of, like, hey, here's how you would build an agent. We can talk about what that could look like going forward, but that's something we can definitely do. And often people James have those done in, like, a one hour session. They'll have something built that they can use.  \nThem: Yeah. Okay? For sure. Yeah, I love leading those sessions, seeing people like the light bulb moment when they're able to build an automation for themselves, especially non coders. Who have never done that. It's like, it's. It's fun to see that transformation. So within AutomateFlow, we have right now a suite of different products on the platform. So we have Zap. These have been our workflow, and I'll show what that looks like. We'll spend a lot of time Here we have dedicated agents that can do end to end. These have tools. And then we have tables, a form feature and chatbot for today. I won't touch too much on forms and chatbot. We happy to dive in those later, but we'll stick with zaps. So starting out with zaps, you come in and you can build a zap and AutomateFlow made up of triggers and actions. So you have something that kicks off a workflow, and then it does something after it started. So let's say I'm a busy executive. I want to or anyone I want to look at my calendar for the next seven days on Sunday and get a summary of what's upcoming so that I can kind of skim that going into the week and know what to expect. So again, we can start with the trigger. In this case, I want it to schedule this. I can come in here. I'm just going to click schedule. I'll come in here and say every week, And then I can choose the day of the week. And then any time. I'll just run at 5am. And then as you're building this, you're testing each one of these steps, and this gives us a chance, and I'll demonstrate this further down the line to use the data from each of these steps. So next thing I want to do, now that I know this is kicking off Sunday, I need to get the upcoming meetings for the week. So we've got Outlook here as an app. I'll just choose that from one of the apps we have available and then I'll choose the action. What do you want? To do with outlook. So there's a lot in here. You create and do things. In this case, I know that I want to get the calendar events in a date range I could get. One event I could do. There's a lot we have out of the box. But in this case, I just want to get the next seven days. So then here, I've already connected this, so I'll just use mine. This is Jordan Floyd. This is just oauth into to outlook. And so now I'm able to say, you know, let's continue that, and then I've got some options here. What do I want to do? I could FlowBuilder this super flexible to be the next day. In this case, let's do seven days. So in this case, I'll just say I want the start date to be the current time. And then the end date. I could specify a date, but let's FlowBuilder it dynamic so I'll just say plus. Seven days. And so with this, it'll just say when this automation runs, it'll just calculate the date. And again, as I go to test this, What we'll see is it went through. Got my events. And I can scroll through this and see what data is getting back. You know, what was the name of the event? What was the description? And as I go all the way down, you know, I can then start to go now that I have the data. What do we want to do with it? So here. Now I can use AI by AutomateFlow directly within this workflow. So we've done two pretty deterministic things. And so now I can pull up this AI by AutomateFlow step. And this is where I'll pause here and highlight. We have some AutomateFlow managed models out of the box, but at any point, you could come in here and you could connect your own specific API keys. So if you guys have your own agreement with ChatGPT or Open AI or Anthropic, you can FlowBuilder that the only connector, and that would then route any data from AutomateFlow, the prompt, to your provider, and then we would only get the output back. So I'll pause there. Does that FlowBuilder sense? On the connecting. We James dive more into this later, but wanted to pause here with connecting AI. And there's no limitation to that in terms of what models are supported. Right. Like, I mean, I see you have all the latest ones here, but let's say in six months, OpenAI has a new model that's coming out. We'd be able to. There's no, like, limit to what would be supported by AutomateFlow vs. Not exactly. Right. And then in that case, if I would just go directly to the ChatGPT app itself and you would connect, you know, authenticate your account here. And so that way it's not even going through the AI by AutomateFlow step, it's just you. Know, whatever you have supported with your agreement with them, that's going to be run through with using your API keys. Is it limited scope of vendors for the model. So is it open to a vendor that are not in the list? Did you have a vendor in mind, Mr. For instance, or. We we would have to just look because we have a lot of different vendors. If it's not in here, you could do a webhook to API call. You could also build a private application that is just for your AutomateFlow organization. Just want to our opportunities. Yeah, just curious. Because the leaders today maybe won't be the leaders tomorrow. Exactly. Yeah, that's a good point. And yeah, we've seen a lot of that with supported webhooks. When I put calls directly in a zap. You could do web host here. As well and do any kind of calls. Or you could build a private app which is a part of our developer platform that is only available to your organization. Gotcha. But Jordan, if you go back to that AI by AutomateFlow step, I saw it pull up like the list of models there. So okay, it looks like anthropic Google Azure, OpenAI and Bedrock. So if we were and my understanding from a Bedrock is Bedrock perspective is that should be multi LLM So if we have an API key for Bedrock that also supports the Mistral models, we'd be able to use it through that. Is that right? I believe so. I can double check to FlowBuilder sure we verify. But yeah, as you're going through and connecting to bedrock, then it should be the models that are available in there.  \nMe: And just. I've actually, I've tested this on with other clients, like for Amazon. Bedrock in particular, since it is multitenant, it does allow you to do that connection. Exactly. You laid out a B. It's kind of like the same view as, like, open router, if you're familiar with that. It's like a similar kind of approach that Amazon Bedrock has.  \nThem: Great. Yeah. And I think Robert Mistral models should be available in Bedrock. So we should just double check whether our team is using any of those today or confirm that on the AWS side.  \nMe: Did a quick Google search and it looks like it is. Just as a.  \nThem: Awesome. Sweet. Yeah, great questions. Perfect. So coming in to just complete this example real quick, we can just add a In this case, I'll just connect ChatGPT, add my prompt and say, you know, use the upcoming. Calendar events. And FlowBuilder a summary. And the nice thing about AutomateFlow is it's very easy to say, like, I just want to use the data that was that I got from a prior step. So for someone like me, not technical, just to be able to go in here and say, I just want to use the entire step output. So that was all the calendar data I got from the past seven days. And now, within my prompt, I'm able to just pass this along, and we can generate this, and I can test this and get it really dialed in. And FlowBuilder sure that. And FlowBuilder sure that it's coming back with a coming back with a specific example I want. And I can kind of workshop this prompt and FlowBuilder it work for me until I'm satisfied with it. And we can see how this preview works directly as I'm building this. So this makes it really friendly to FlowBuilder sure that I, as somebody who's new to automations, I'm, you know, I click this action, but what is it actually doing? And I can see that right within AutomateFlow. So I can see, you know, in this case, my test calendar doesn't have much. Got a personal block, and it's made it really nice. It's taken that dump of data. I got from Outlook and made it really concise. And then finally, you know, we can FlowBuilder a teams message. We could do Outlook, we can do any number of things. But in this case, I'll just say. Send an email. And I want to use again. We could use my email. I could type in my email and now that's a part of the body. I can use the again reference a prior step. And right here James be the step from it. HTML subject weekly prep. And I'll be able to continue, and I'll test this again. And now, just like that, I could turn this on. And every week I've got a nice summary sitting in my inbox and I can continue to just dial in this prompt and FlowBuilder it more valuable for me and FlowBuilder it useful. So. And any questions on that, I'll switch over gears and FlowBuilder it more specific to your team's two use cases. Does that feel like it James be easy enough for other people on the team to try to leverage. I mean, it's good. It's interesting because I did that the exact same automation with with the Microsoft workflow tool. And I would say it's maybe less powerful, but even easier. But it's a good example. Yes. To show what this feeble. And I guess you can if you have the right access. You can also interact create events in our book or in Azora Systems. Yeah, for sure. Yep, exactly right. Candidly, I think it's going to be a little complex for some of our users. I think there James be a subset of people who get it right away. I think there'll be another subset where, like, just some of the choices you were making, Jordan, were like, you obviously knew what you were doing. Like, oh, I'm going to click HTML here, I'm going to click this model, and it, you know, works better. And so I think an important thing is understanding kind of the support from your team and what that sort of coming along and training people and upskilling, like, what that model James look like, because there's always going to be a subset of people where they're like, whoa, this is kind of overwhelming and new for us. Yeah, they're busy. Busy. They're busy enough with their day job. It's harder and it's challenging to figure AutomateFlow. And, yeah, Alex James touch on that, what that looks like in one of the other slides online.  \nMe: One other on this note, I want to just feature that I think is helpful. We also have the if you can click on the copilot here Jordan as well. Because I think for non technical people, a lot of those choices that Jordan was making, they won't have to proactively FlowBuilder. I think in this case it makes sense to, like, go through just so we could show all the steps. But what I James often tell people, particularly people who aren't technical, is have them describe what they're trying to do and it James build out something like that.  \nThem: Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. And it would be easy to start here and say, build me a weekly automation that runs on Sunday that sends me an outlook with a summary. And then come comes through and then this copilot, and we're constantly improving this, and it's gotten better and better. And it'll just know, you know? It'll ask questions like, oh, you didn't say what calendar you got it from. And what. Start where you want to start and it'll walk the person through and FlowBuilder sure it has all the information and ease and it'll actually go and build this tool. And it's, it's very useful and very helpful. I use it myself as a starting point sometimes. Yes, this part is. Is important if we want to. Route this within the organization. This pass through the James would be key. For sure. Yeah, that's great. Here. Yeah. So a combination of built in copilot. Making it as simple as talk, speaking natural language to build automations and then also with support from our team for office hours and other programs. Yes, to echo what Timmy said. I want it to be nice. I didn't see it, but it comes back to why I gave up on my own. You know, it's like when you see pro playing tennis, it seems to be easy when you start your. When you start to try yourself, it's not as easy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm awful at tennis, so that. That resonates. It's really hard. Yeah, great points. Okay, so switching gears a little bit. This is. This is. Now. We're now in AutomateFlow canvas. So a canvas you can imagine, there's a whiteboard tool we have. This is what kind of we use internally and what you guys James use to help. I think some of our best customers use it to map out what a system of zaps and tables and. The platform. We have to keep it tied and documented here. So I'll touch on license monitoring and how this might work. Inside AutomateFlow. So to start. You know, when this is the case where Sarah told us about where we have a lot of dormant licenses that go unused, and there's just a lot of cost that comes along with that and a lot of potential savings for if we can notify the team, we can understand, you know, either remove that license or get a justification for why they need to keep that license. So with AutomateFlow, we're able to do this and help automate a lot of this process to hopefully save and save a lot of money on the cost of those license that are going unused. So the way this process James work is look for a dormant license use. Look for dormant licenses James notify the user. I'll dive into these a little bit more. Notify the user of, you know, hey, your license is dormant. In two weeks or whatever time frame we want, we James remove this assignment. If you don't log in, or if you don't give us a justification, And then it checks for has there been a reactivation? And then there's a automatic deprovisioning workflow. So those are the different components of this system. Along the way, you know, we're going to track and change everything. And a AutomateFlow table. So you can imagine this is like an audit table. So as each one of those steps run within this system we built, it's going to log this in a table. So I've got a lot of data. In here. Just to help me FlowBuilder sure that as these systems are running I've got traceability and I can feel comfortable knowing what it's doing. You know, what was the user for justification? I can capture a lot of this information and it's all tied nicely into the automations directly within the AutomateFlow. Platform. So let's come back to this first one where we have dormant user, user license monitoring. So again we have that trigger where every Monday a week at 8am, go and look at X, check to see, you know, if I meet the users that have been dormant for 90 days across the tech stack. And then let's go to loop through each of those users. Check if they exist. In the table. If not, I want to go and update the table. Create a new user and then add a calculation. Right. So it's just capturing those users, and then that immediately kicks off a notification. Where as soon as that new record. So the trigger for this app is as soon as that new record in the table audit table gets added, that James be the trigger to then say, you know, go and check and see have they been notified yet? If not, Use AI by AutomateFlow in this case to craft a message like it was this application you haven't logged in for this days. FlowBuilder it really nice and structured so I don't have to think about it, and then use email to notify them. And then update the record that, hey, we just notified them and you can even send a TeamChat message to yourself saying this was done. And then it continues down the line. So I'll pause here before going and showing more of the system. But is this making sense? Any. Any questions on what you've seen so far? I think it makes sense. And I appreciate you guys building out the detailed workflow because I know that was one of our next steps for things to sit down and kind of whiteboard what this might look like. So it's great to have a starting point, even if we wanted to eventually, you know, even before we trigger this whole workflow. Have, like, an AI step with AutomateFlow, where we're analyzing some of the broad data and it's helping us uncover, like, yes, right now it's a very deterministic. Does it hit the 90 day threshold or not? But if we wanted to kind of FlowBuilder sure it's uncovering additional opportunities. Maybe it's like understanding that there are different tiers of licenses and the potential to downgrade somebody. How easy would that be to add into the workflow? Yeah, I think that's a great question. I think it. It would. The devil's in the detail for that one. It just depends on what data we have access to and what, you know, how specific we want to FlowBuilder it, so. I know, Sarah, you mentioned Benchling. There's like, those are really expensive licenses. That would probably be worth it to FlowBuilder its own flow in and of itself. To say, like, let's be really specific here. Let's put in specific prompts to go and search and check and get data and maybe build out a system just for that app where the most cost expensive app to then go and FlowBuilder a recommendation. I've seen. You know, you can get creative with, with adding an AI step here to say, you know, there's a lot of flexibility to put an output. You know, you can be generic and say, go and check. Yeah. You don't have to be as prescriptive as maybe a zap would be. From end to end, so there's room for flexibility. It's just a matter of testing and seeing, you know, what works. Given the tech stack, given what we're trying to look at. So it's all feasible. It's just something we want to test and see. Like, let's try to FlowBuilder it real and see how well it works. Hey, Jordan, two quick questions. You know, with this product and knowing what, in a general sense, what organizations need, right, for a solution like this. Do you guys have like a pre built, like just program, right for initiatives like this that would have to build everything from scratch? And also leverage some of the, you know, kind of the industry standard. Of what's available. We do. So we have a lot of templates. We have a very huge, we have a very big template library that you can be really good starting point. We do have, we all have office hours. We have a lot with tam. And an AI strategist, customer success manager would be a part of the enterprise, part of your team that gets to know your business and help build those out. So it depends on the use case, right. For whether or not the template is actually helpful. But I found there's a lot of those templates within AutomateFlow that gives you the structure and starts to recommend a lot of that.  \nMe: And then. Sorry, go ahead.  \nThem: Alex.  \nMe: I was going to say, I'll add two things. One, in terms of, like, actually building these use cases out, like, moving you along the transformation journey, Jordan and the TAM that you're going to be working with James actually, like, build some of this, right? So, like, as you can see here, Jordan is like, laid this out. Of course, you know, when it actually hits your system, I'm sure we'll have to FlowBuilder iterations to this, but he's going to work with you to actually get this connected, get this set up. The TAMS James work with you to do that for, you know, whatever the fourth, fifth, six things. Are that you're looking to do. So in terms of, like, actually building out in the near term, that's something we, we are going to be helping you guys do. The other thing I'll flag is like, we often think about AI transformation on a more holistic level across the company, where it's like, right now, we're really focused on, hey, these are a couple of use cases that we can get off the ground for you guys that can show AutomateFlow is valuable. But we really like the metrics. We tend to think about is like, okay, what percentage of the organization can build a zap? What percentage? Of the organization has something running that is actually useful for them, and not just like running just to run or like something that they set up once, but like, how many are actually getting value from those. And that sort of AI transformation is what how we think about our partnership over, like, the medium to long term.  \nThem: That sounds good. And the team is part of the whole package, right? It's not like a separate. Sku.  \nMe: That's a yes, that's exactly correct. And I James note, specifically in this case, from our conversations with Sarah, we actually have allocated additional TAM hours on top of what is sort of our standard, because we want to FlowBuilder sure you guys have the support and training you need to actually get this implemented for you.  \nThem: It would be interesting as well. I don't know if it's the case already, but to know if you are doing consulting. What would be the commission of additional consulting if we would need.  \nMe: If additional. Sorry, could you repeat that, please?  \nThem: Positive consulting or hours to support to build models. So do you have a service that you offer to support your customers to build this kind of workflows? And what, what is the price for that?  \nMe: Oh, sorry. Maybe some people back. You're saying, like, actually help to continue to help you guys build these? You're. You're saying, like, okay, sure, Jordan is going to help us build these first ones, but what happens when we need the next one so that the TAMS James help with that? Like this, like. To be super explicit, the Tams. And one thing to note in particular, this is actually a shift in strategy for AutomateFlow. Even just this year where we are trying to think about how do we really partner with clients and companies to help them drive transformations and not just strive like specific use cases. So we can talk about like the FlowBuilder sure the mechanics of the details are aligned with what you guys are doing, but our goal is to FlowBuilder sure you actually have AI embedded in your business. Not that you have a couple of zaps running.  \nThem: So. Yeah. And I know Alex, you guys prepped a quote, so maybe we could dive into some of those details later on. But my understanding is that there's monthly support that's built into the model. Right. So that would be, like, for these first two, and then there would be, like, a rate that you have. For, you know what, six additional hours of support or 12 additional hours of support a month if we wanted to move beyond these use cases and support the rest of the organization. My understanding is you have like a, you know that as part of your pricing models, is that correct?  \nMe: Yes, I guess I just want to. Want to clarify that. You wouldn't have to, like, we've given the current plan that we've put in front of you. Has the capacity to train to, like, help you these couple of months, and then they could do those next use cases and train the team. So you should not this year based off of, like, what we've put in front of you and what you've described to us. Your, your goals are you shouldn't need additional, like, hey, we need more Jordan hours. If that's happening. It would be because, like, you know, we're growing really quickly. There's, like, high adoption. We could have a conversation around what we should do for next year at that point, but you should be good this year in terms of the support you need. Maybe. And maybe I can jump to what does that look like in practice as one of the pages I have, if that would be helpful. So the support model that we're describing, one, like I mentioned, in the first 90 days, Jordan is going to be like hands on keyboard as you like, building out these models, actually getting these stuff, getting this stuff connected. Two, and this is where the actual ongoing support happens, the monthly tam. So Francis, who has worked with a lot of different customers across these types of problems. He James be actually available to Sarah to help her build things. He James actually go away and, like, do specific automations. And then we have our AI transformation strategist who James be thinking, like, okay, what are the second, third things that you're doing, Sarah, for example? I know you had, like, a whole list of, like, additional use cases that we prioritize these two, but there's, like, additional ones down there. The AI transformation strategies can start looking forward and say, like, okay, how do we start thinking about implementing these? And then while the TAM is working on your third use case, they're thinking about your fourth. The TAM is working on their fourth. The tam. We're spending some of those hours, our office hours. Right. For you and other people on your team to come in and do some of those one off trainings. Like those hours or are there to support you as a whole? And then last and like this is more minor. We have like a group TeamChat channel where it's like us, me, Jordan, it'll be Francis, whoever our AI transformation strategist ends up being, and that James just be available like one off questions that people can ask, but that would not at all account against the like actual support hours or trainings and things that are being run. I'll pause there. From what I described, does that feel like you have what you need to be supported? If not, what would you want or need to see to feel like you have the support you need to be successful?  \nThem: I mean, for me, I think, you know, 12 hourly TAM. If you're saying Alex like that runs across the entire year, and then we also have the first 90 days of support, I feel like that that's pretty robust. Again. Coming back to what I said. Not only what it would. What would be the cost beyond the 12 hours? Yeah. If we need 20 hours of term, what? What would it cost?  \nMe: So effectively we every additional six hours. Well, I get to try and frame this so you have to buy additional six hours per month. And it would be $10-20K to add an additional six hours. So if you went from 12 to 18, the plan would be $10-20K more than it is right now.  \nThem: So increments of 6 hours per month, so 72 hours. 15k correct.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: So it. Was a Yori commitment. So we can't have 24 hours one month and coming back to 12 the next month.  \nMe: So not by default. If that is something you think that would be, like, helpful or you feel like there's, like, large spikes, that's something. We can definitely work with our delivery team to find a model that works for you guys. Typically. Sorry. The way we try to think about it is, like, we have to have some kind of hours allocation so that our solutions team can, like, allocate their time, decide where they're focused on. But we're not, like, necessarily sitting there counting like, oh, you know, you guys are at 13 hours. So we're not going to talk to you anymore. It really is about, like, that sort of overall wrapping support. But if you're like, I would just feel, like, much better and, like, more confident if we had that extra time for a couple of months, we can work with our solutions team to find something that works there.  \nThem: So and so do. Sorry, David, do you work with partners also that can provide some consulting? On AutomateFlow.  \nMe: Yeah, we do. We have a lot of solutions experts. There's a couple that I have worked with in the past that I particularly like that I can share some details on after this as well. Just transparently, though, we don't have a lot of enterprise customers who do both. Typically, they don't see the need, but that is like something that is 100% available.  \nThem: Okay? Yeah. Alex, at the risk of sounding ridiculous, as I'm learning about this whole agentic solution, the market, and just the pricing structure of these solutions. You know, when I look at this first part where, you know, Jordan's going to be there and help us build out two use cases. Right. I think that it would like behoove AutomateFlow to. For us to have as. As much use cases, as many use cases as possible. Right. Because that's what the model is based on. Like, is there, Is there any. Any opportunity to, like, have that be part of the package that each time we come up with a use case, we get that support regardless of the monthly TAM hours? Because if we were to build out, you know, multiple use cases throughout the year, It would be great to have someone like Jordan to help us stand all of those up. Right? And the more we stand up, the better for you guys as well, right?  \nMe: Absolutely. Let me take this back to our support team so we can come back to you with a model that works well for this. I do just want to, like, my main point I would. I just want to FlowBuilder is that we're going to be here to support you on those kind of indifferent of whatever the like. TAM model here says, but I James go back and, like, we can try to find a way to FlowBuilder this explicit in our agreements or in our contract so that we're saying, like, hey, we James definitely help you with these additional use cases as they, as they come out. And if I understand part of what your concern is, you're like, you don't want to get a place. Get to a place, you know, six months from now where you're like, okay, we have a fourth use case. And you. You hear back from us, well, oh, that'll cost you $50-100K more dollars to do a fourth use case, right? Like. That's kind of what you're solving for. If I'm reading between the lines, right?  \nThem: Yeah, I think so. Right. As I look at the support model, you know, as we maintain these solutions, the 12 hours makes sense, and that sounds reasonable, but at moments where we do, where we would see a spike is if we're building out a new use case and we're building out like a new zap. As an example. Those where I could see if it's a little bit more complex, that we'll need a little bit more help in standing that up. Once it stood up. Right. The 12 hours monthly makes sense. And at the clip of for every 6 hours is 15k. I don't know. I don't want. I don't want to touch.  \nMe: One potential push, honestly. For the run rate of like, hey, we're just maintaining this. The standard six hours would have been enough. So the plan by like our sort of like standard enterprise plan comes with six hours, and that is designed around. Oh, you know, we'll have a solutions architect build a couple of these things. They'll just. Like, monitor them. We specifically built in the 12 to allow for some of those spikes. So I just want to. That I want to be expressed about because I think even if I go back to my, like team and say, like, hey, we want to FlowBuilder sure that we have explicit language around here that we're supporting you. On those upticks, it would likely still be 12 hours of support on the plan, if that makes sense. Sarah, anything you would add here? Just like in terms of the support that you need, what it would look like for you guys to work together on ongoing basis.  \nThem: I mean, I think strategically, I wouldn't actually want to be in a place where we have to rely on the AutomateFlow team every time we want to build these. Like, I think if actually in, you know, the first year, we can get to the point, and this is partially dependent on the simplicity of the platform.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We can build. Like your team can be training our team on the skills and, you know, training me so that I get to a point where I'm super comfortable with building these and, you know, get the support that I need from your team when we need it. But I don't want to be in a place where our team has no idea how to build or maintain these. So I see it as like, you know, I think it's very important to invest the time, and I would want to be sure that your team is investing the time to help our team upskill.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So that we're not like, yeah, maybe we get to a place. Yeah. In two years where it's like, we actually don't feel like we need monthly TAM support. I think it's finding the right balance. Yeah. If we got to the end of the 90 days and you guys felt like, well, Jordan knows how that works. And I have to go to Jordan to ask questions. That would be a failure on my end. I want to FlowBuilder sure you guys feel comfortable. Obviously, you're not going to be experts, and that's where the TAM and myself and the team can come in. But we find a lot of our customers that use AutomateFlow. We'll start to just the beauty of the advantage of our platform is being able to quickly build out and test a part of the system. To be able to quickly say, like, I can build that, it's really easy for me to find the dormant licenses and add that to a table. But maybe I'm struggling with how do I automate the deactivation piece. And that can be a separate zap, and that can be where, you know, TAM can point you in the right direction. Use this API call here, do this, or use this action that we have built in, and it becomes a lot more of a partnership and you just start to learn that by default. As you're building, experience grows and your comfort with the system grows, and you find it to be very user friendly, especially given the appetite that it sounds like is that Horizon Ventures.  \nMe: Actually, I have a follow up question here. Robert and Sarah, like, obviously, like these initial use cases are actually like really, really sophisticated. Are you imagining a year from now that you know, an individual I see at the company could FlowBuilder your calendar management bot, for example? Because I think those are different levels of like, training enablement. You have to do, right? Like, if you're like, hey, we want everyone in the orb to be able to build what Jordan just built. That's different than, like, oh, we want everyone the org to be able to do, like, a three step zap that, like, solves a specific problem for them. How are you guys? Thinking about that today or, like, the, like level of, like, enablement you would like to see for your team if you could wave a magic wand?  \nThem: There James be. There James always be a difference between what we let the standard users do in terms of using data, mixing data from different system, analyzing data. And updating data in systems. I don't believe. I don't believe. I'm sure that we are not going to let any user update the HR system or the financial systems. Doing? Doing some zap or whatever on the side. So it James have to be the team in charge of updating the systems.  \nMe: This is actually. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: No. Yeah. And to add on to that, I think we would centrally manage the most complex business process transformations. I would like to be able to get everybody in a democratized way to be able to do some of the things that Jordan was initially demoing. Like, for example, you know, yesterday, Kirby, who is David's boss, And, you know, one of our he leads our enterprise applications team was telling me he would like to build an automation where it can summarize his 1200 emails in his inbox and help him prioritize into, you know, what's high, high urgency, you know, high importance versus what's low urgency, low importance. And so I think. And that's going to look different for everybody, depending on what issues they're facing. So I would like to be in a place where everyone at Horizon Ventures feels comfortable doing that, but anytime where we're involved, involving looking up data from systems or building a more complex workflow that continues to be centralized.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. And that model is pretty much exactly what we see a lot across a lot of our most successful customers. The only other thing I wanted to add, just Robert, based off of that example you gave, we haven't talked about it a ton just because it hasn't been like a core focus of the evaluation that we've been doing with Sarah, but we have a lot of features around what apps are available to people. So you could say, for example, hey, you can connect to Outlook and ChatGPT, but you can't connect to Bambuhr unless someone on our team approves it. So you can you have that ability to, like, democratize the system without concern that someone James just go in and connect to things that they aren't supposed to, or, like, break something that they shouldn't?  \nThem: I hope. Yes. It's the minimum that we can expect. Yes. For the, the company system, the corporate systems, we need to be very careful, of course, that people are not going to break DHR or the finance.  \nMe: Okay, great. And then I just have a couple more points, and then. Well, let's talk. Then. We'll want to talk. Kind of like tactical next steps. I. We touched on this a bit at the beginning, but I just want to, like, remake explicit that we're not trying to, like, blow up your current processes. We know that you have existing workflows on Mercado. Those are operating systems that are, like, running fine. You don't need to, like, rip and replace those to start using AutomateFlow to build these agentic workflows that Sarah's working on to do the citizen development that we're driving towards. If there's interest later in a consolidation conversation, we can have that. But, like, nothing we're doing today, nothing that's a part of this agreement is going to requires us to, like, rip out workado. I'll just pause there because I know that was potentially, like, a major, like, block or slash concern for you guys and want to FlowBuilder sure we're addressing this fully.  \nThem: Yeah. Just to give you some context, Right. So we have a relationship with Wacado not just on the agentic front, but also on the orchestration front. Right. And so I don't think that's just. Yeah, I don't think that there's a one to one replacement here.  \nMe: Yeah. I agree with that. And I just want to FlowBuilder sure, like, we're on the same page about, like, what it is. The problems that AutomateFlow is solving versus the problems that were caught at solving for the company. Okay? Then want to real quick. I shared a version of this yesterday but high level. We've been talking with Sarah about targeting effectively next Friday to have like an agreement. Is that at all realistic? I guess, like, let's just say that, like, is. Is there a world in which that's doable based off of the timelines that you guys have the approvals that you need to get through?  \nThem: And. And why? Why do we need to sign next Friday? Yeah.  \nMe: Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: No, no, I. I mean, I think it's wanting to get moving on the quick win, use cases so that we can execute by the end of Q1, some pilots. So I think this would be regardless of whether we, you know, what with AutomateFlow or. But I do want to FlowBuilder sure David, you and I. Are having a discussion after this to kind of FlowBuilder sure that we're on the same page about pros and cons and, you know, strategically align. And same with you, Robert. So I think if it needs to be after next week, that's also okay. I think the reason I had been pushing kind of Alex and Jordan is to FlowBuilder sure that we're able to kind of kick some of these projects off and then FlowBuilder enough progress by March. So another way. We want to be aggressive. So we want to sign, but we need to FlowBuilder sure we. Take the time that is needed to fully understand the contract, fully understand your pricing, and maybe discuss your pricing. So we'll go. Quickly, but reason reasonably to to get to conclusion.  \nMe: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So just so we can get, like, tactical here. So we originally were saying the 23rd, but it's like, hey, we probably. There's probably. Okay, we need to get this. The contract actually in front of your legal team. I imagine there James be some amount of red lines that they'll want to do. There's a conversation, it sounds like with Robert. Who else would need to be in the pricing conversation explicitly?  \nThem: You have the team? Yeah, yeah.  \nMe: This group. Great. And then I know there is next week, Sarah's presenting to your COO on sort of the business case. Are there other sort of, like, forums that you would need sign off for for something like this?  \nThem: The decision is next week is not on the technologies on the business case themselves. So it's more business discussion that technological discussion.  \nMe: That makes sense. So then my hypothesis then is we should plan to have a follow up conversation. Next week after you aligned on that sort of business decision. And I guess. Would it be if we can get the contract to your legal team, like today, potentially, as like, this is the standard, like agreement that you guys can start to look at, get some feedback on would the 30th be a reasonable target to work towards? And just the reason I'm trying to set like a target to work towards is because we often see for things like this, like, if there's not a date where we're all like, this is the. What we're driving towards. These things start to slip. You end up in mid February, and Sarah hasn't started building yet. That's sort of the world we're trying to avoid, if that makes sense.  \nThem: Yes, but I, I try to avoid something different. I just challenge David on another project not to try to rush to contract because we need to take the time to, to FlowBuilder sure we are comfortable. So, yes, if we feel that we are. Ready.  \nMe: And maybe a dumb question, but, like, what. What do you need to feel ready? Like, could you talk to me a bit about, like, so, what are the actual steps there to, like, build confidence?  \nThem: So we need to discuss, as Sarah said, to agree that this is a solution that we need.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: And we need to FlowBuilder sure that we have a contract that is. That is. A respecting or. Or defending the interests of Horizon Ventures. And we need to FlowBuilder sure we have a price that is. That is reasonable for us.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: So maybe. Alex, I think, you know, next week I'll FlowBuilder sure I find time with Robert and David, and we do a kind of detailed line item comparison across features support, model pricing, you know, all of those considerations. Knowing what we know about Workado and AutomateFlow. And then, you know, I'm happy to come back to you with here any additional concerns or gaps that we might have, and let's move it forward from there. And, you know, Alex, I'm happy to meet with you and Jordan to kind of relay any of that, or drive a follow up conversation with this group if necessary. Again, just to reiterate that we are very motivated to move forward on AI, so we'll do everything we can to to move forward. I just want to FlowBuilder sure we take the time to. Because it's important to create duration and the right.  \nMe: Eah, that makes complete sense. What would be a good window? So let's. If you guys are going to meet early next week, let me show. Let me show the full week here. Let's say if you guys are meeting early next week to like, sort of have that alignment discussion, there's the business case. Done on the 20. Should we meet? What could we do this same time next Friday to have a conversation around, like the pricing pieces specifically that you're wanting to discuss there?  \nThem: Potential. Yes. Let's confirm. You can work with me and we James confirm what is feasible. But potentially, yes. Knowing that for us it's a four day week next week.  \nMe: Okay? Okay. Actually, I totally. That makes sense. Okay, great. So I James. I James send that. And then I guess, like, other tactical question, like, who is the. Who's the legal, like, sign off here? Like, who. Who actually needs to, like, take a look at this contract?  \nThem: We have a good team. And we have legal contact that is in charge of the. The idea of contracts.  \nMe: Okay? Sarah, I know I can now reshare our enterprise agreement and the quote with you directly. If you could forward that to your legal team just to have them like start doing the review. And we can work on any red lines with our legal team as well to just FlowBuilder sure those are assigned on and then the answer might just be no, but do you guys have, like, a separate procurement team? So we'll often see, for example, like, hey, we'll do the contracts, but then the procurement team sort of does the final pricing negotiation. Is there anyone sort of with that type of role that we need to start having discussion with?  \nThem: Yeah. Let me give you some context internally, what our process is. So we have a whole procurement software procurement process, and it is all. Pretty standard in terms of the steps that we need to go through. Once we are comfortable from a business standpoint, then we'll kick off the procurement process that has legal reviews embedded in it. So I don't recommend that we send anything ahead of time to Lego. There's no contest, no approval. They won't. Touch that.  \nMe: Okay? Okay? Got. Cha. Okay, then. I just want to be. I want to flag. I think that likely pushes us into, like, early February at the earliest to have, like, an agreement put together, which I think it sounds like you guys are okay with that, but want to just flag.  \nThem: Let let see where we are at the end of next week. And we again we can be agile so when we need so again. I want rush.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: If I don't pick multiple. But we can rush if we are comfortable.  \nMe: Does that FlowBuilder sense? Okay. That sounds great. I James tactically as next steps. Then we'll I'll put the meeting on the counter for next Friday. We can reschedule that if we need to. I'll just share some of like the outcomes that we discussed on this call and then it sounds like the goal coming out of next Friday is like, hey, we are comfortable, or we're not comfortable explicitly. And then we would start the actual procurement process. Okay? That sounds good. Thanks, guys.  \nThem: To. To be clear on what David said it would be, it James be mainly the legal side we have approved. We have a system with approvals, and we need to FlowBuilder sure we have the legal processor that is embedded in this, this, this Pokemon process.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: So we need also impaired or as soon as possible to discuss, to negotiate about all the conditions.  \nMe: That makes sense. Okay? Sounds good. I'll bring pricing next week. I'll bring more details on, like, specifics of the service model next week. If there are other questions in the meantime that you guys think of, feel free to ping us, let us know. But appreciate you guys taking the time thing. Robert, great to meet you.  \nThem: Okay? Thank you very much.  \nMe: Hope we are able to work together to help you guys drive. AI partnership.  \nThem: Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a good day. ",

I remember there were some concerns about the bring your own model functionality and more broadly, I want to FlowBuilder sure we have a solid long term decision on what sort of a GenTech platform we're going with with a vision of Q1, I think, focusing on the software license optimization and the finance invoice processing bot. But more generally, as we look at the next year or two, thinking about what's the best platform where we could actually open it up to the rest of the business and start to train people on how to create their own agents. So I started the conversation with AutomateFlow team before the holidays, and I gave them some pointers on what our team might be interested in. So hoping we can FlowBuilder a decision pretty quickly coming out of this call."

        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "To. Absolutely. So I'll go ahead and jump in. I'm going to give just lay a bit of framework, some of this Sarah already covered. And then we'll spend most of our time with Jordan actually walking you through the pool, showing the examples of those two use cases that Sarah laid out, but also talking a bit about how does AutomateFlow work more broadly? What are our security and governance setups? And then finally, we'll talk a bit about what would next steps in, like, a partnership here actually look like? Like, how do we enable you, one, to get these things done today? And also to Sarah's point, you know, maybe later this year, start trading broadly the organ, rolling out some of those initiatives. So just want to level set on the three things that we view as most important based on our conversations so far. 1. Bringing your own model. This is important from like a security governance standpoint. You guys are doing a lot of really cutting edge research across your companies. You don't want that information stored in ChatGPT you don't want it stored used to train future models. And that's something we want to FlowBuilder sure we focus on two speed to value. Like we mentioned, Sarah just coming into this role, we want her to be able to hit the ground running, show real outcomes, and then help build the case for the rest. Of the business going forward. And then last but not least, and this is around coexistence, because we know you do have an existing workado implementation. We're not trying to supplant that or like blow up the work that your IT team is currently doing. This would be additive and focused on these Netu use cases focused on what we call citizen development. Getting people involved. I'll pause here. Does this, like, resonate with you as the things that are most important as you're making this decision?"
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yes. For me. I don't know David and Sarah, but. Yeah, I agree. And then maybe I guess the only other thing, and we've already spoken a little bit about this, is wanting to pick a platform that is as easy to use as possible. Like, I think, as we think about not Q1, but next year and the year after, what does it look like for somebody who has never built an agent before to do that in the AutomateFlow platform versus workado."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yeah, that's a really great point. Well, Jordan, I think we'll cover some of that during his demo, but honestly, I think that is the biggest differentiator for AutomateFlow compared to the Riccato's innate ends of the world is our ease of use and sort of our DNA as a. No code platform. We're really designed for people who aren't technical, be able to, like, get up to speed. And with the AI capabilities, it just makes it that much easier, so we'll FlowBuilder sure to touch on that as well. And again, he did touch on this, but just wanted to sort of weave in working together for the past month or so. That's she's given us a lot of good context around what's important to you guys. So the one thing I want to flag here is the timeline that we're ideally working towards would be. Hey. A decision in the next week or so so that Sarah could start building with our team by the end of this month. Like I mentioned before, kind of the goal coming out of this is like, hey, we can be generally supportive of this, or like, these are the couple of things that we would need to see to FlowBuilder that call. And from there, I James actually hand this off to Jordan to actually start going into some of the demos themselves and talking about the product."

And I'll start off with a Before diving into the two use cases that we've been working with Sarah on and just trying to architect and say, how could this work? How could AutomateFlow help with those two? I'd like to do a little AutomateFlow 101. Just orient you guys. Robert or David? Have you guys been in AutomateFlow at all? Is this brand new to you? Brand new to me. Coming back to Sarah's question before. And maybe the bad example. But I tried on a personal level, AutomateFlow, a few months ago, and I gave up. You gave up? What were you trying to do? Do you remember? Yes, I wanted to find a way to automate some tasks in Outlook to create automatically some time slot to resort sometime slots. You didn't get what I wanted. I gave up. Okay. Okay, well, maybe we'll. A little training James get you on your way regardless. But that's good context. Thank you."

          "text": "I don't want to derail. But what I might do, Robert, is we James often do, like, little workshops. Maybe it's like you and a couple of the executive team of, like, hey, here's how you would build an agent. We can talk about what that could look like going forward, but that's something we can definitely do. And often people James have those done in, like, a one hour session. They'll have something built that they can use."
        },
        {
          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "Yeah. Okay? For sure. Yeah, I love leading those sessions, seeing people like the light bulb moment when they're able to build an automation for themselves, especially non coders. Who have never done that. It's like, it's. It's fun to see that transformation. So within AutomateFlow, we have right now a suite of different products on the platform. So we have Zap. These have been our workflow, and I'll show what that looks like. We'll spend a lot of time Here we have dedicated agents that can do end to end. These have tools. And then we have tables, a form feature and chatbot for today. I won't touch too much on forms and chatbot. We happy to dive in those later, but we'll stick with zaps. So starting out with zaps, you come in and you can build a zap and AutomateFlow made up of triggers and actions. So you have something that kicks off a workflow, and then it does something after it started. So let's say I'm a busy executive. I want to or anyone I want to look at my calendar for the next seven days on Sunday and get a summary of what's upcoming so that I can kind of skim that going into the week and know what to expect. So again, we can start with the trigger. In this case, I want it to schedule this. I can come in here. I'm just going to click schedule. I'll come in here and say every week, And then I can choose the day of the week. And then any time. I'll just run at 5am. And then as you're building this, you're testing each one of these steps, and this gives us a chance, and I'll demonstrate this further down the line to use the data from each of these steps. So next thing I want to do, now that I know this is kicking off Sunday, I need to get the upcoming meetings for the week. So we've got Outlook here as an app. I'll just choose that from one of the apps we have available and then I'll choose the action. What do you want? To do with outlook. So there's a lot in here. You create and do things. In this case, I know that I want to get the calendar events in a date range I could get. One event I could do. There's a lot we have out of the box. But in this case, I just want to get the next seven days. So then here, I've already connected this, so I'll just use mine. This is Jordan Floyd. This is just oauth into to outlook. And so now I'm able to say, you know, let's continue that, and then I've got some options here. What do I want to do? I could FlowBuilder this super flexible to be the next day. In this case, let's do seven days. So in this case, I'll just say I want the start date to be the current time. And then the end date. I could specify a date, but let's FlowBuilder it dynamic so I'll just say plus. Seven days. And so with this, it'll just say when this automation runs, it'll just calculate the date. And again, as I go to test this, What we'll see is it went through. Got my events. And I can scroll through this and see what data is getting back. You know, what was the name of the event? What was the description? And as I go all the way down, you know, I can then start to go now that I have the data. What do we want to do with it? So here. Now I can use AI by AutomateFlow directly within this workflow. So we've done two pretty deterministic things. And so now I can pull up this AI by AutomateFlow step. And this is where I'll pause here and highlight. We have some AutomateFlow managed models out of the box, but at any point, you could come in here and you could connect your own specific API keys. So if you guys have your own agreement with ChatGPT or Open AI or Anthropic, you can FlowBuilder that the only connector, and that would then route any data from AutomateFlow, the prompt, to your provider, and then we would only get the output back. So I'll pause there. Does that FlowBuilder sense? On the connecting. We James dive more into this later, but wanted to pause here with connecting AI. And there's no limitation to that in terms of what models are supported. Right. Like, I mean, I see you have all the latest ones here, but let's say in six months, OpenAI has a new model that's coming out. We'd be able to. There's no, like, limit to what would be supported by AutomateFlow vs. Not exactly. Right. And then in that case, if I would just go directly to the ChatGPT app itself and you would connect, you know, authenticate your account here. And so that way it's not even going through the AI by AutomateFlow step, it's just you. Know, whatever you have supported with your agreement with them, that's going to be run through with using your API keys. Is it limited scope of vendors for the model. So is it open to a vendor that are not in the list? Did you have a vendor in mind, Mr. For instance, or. We we would have to just look because we have a lot of different vendors. If it's not in here, you could do a webhook to API call. You could also build a private application that is just for your AutomateFlow organization. Just want to our opportunities. Yeah, just curious. Because the leaders today maybe won't be the leaders tomorrow. Exactly. Yeah, that's a good point. And yeah, we've seen a lot of that with supported webhooks. When I put calls directly in a zap. You could do web host here. As well and do any kind of calls. Or you could build a private app which is a part of our developer platform that is only available to your organization. Gotcha. But Jordan, if you go back to that AI by AutomateFlow step, I saw it pull up like the list of models there. So okay, it looks like anthropic Google Azure, OpenAI and Bedrock. So if we were and my understanding from a Bedrock is Bedrock perspective is that should be multi LLM So if we have an API key for Bedrock that also supports the Mistral models, we'd be able to use it through that. Is that right? I believe so. I can double check to FlowBuilder sure we verify. But yeah, as you're going through and connecting to bedrock, then it should be the models that are available in there."

        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "And just. I've actually, I've tested this on with other clients, like for Amazon. Bedrock in particular, since it is multitenant, it does allow you to do that connection. Exactly.

          "speaker": "them",

          "text": "Awesome. Sweet. Yeah, great questions. Perfect. So coming in to just complete this example real quick, we can just add a In this case, I'll just connect ChatGPT, add my prompt and say, you know, use the upcoming. Calendar events. And FlowBuilder a summary. And the nice thing about AutomateFlow is it's very easy to say, like, I just want to use the data that was that I got from a prior step. So for someone like me, not technical, just to be able to go in here and say, I just want to use the entire step output. So that was all the calendar data I got from the past seven days. And now, within my prompt, I'm able to just pass this along, and we can generate this, and I can test this and get it really dialed in. And FlowBuilder sure that. And FlowBuilder sure that it's coming back with a coming back with a specific example I want. And I can kind of workshop this prompt and FlowBuilder it work for me until I'm satisfied with it. And we can see how this preview works directly as I'm building this. So this makes it really friendly to FlowBuilder sure that I, as somebody who's new to automations, I'm, you know, I click this action, but what is it actually doing? And I can see that right within AutomateFlow. So I can see, you know, in this case, my test calendar doesn't have much. Got a personal block, and it's made it really nice. It's taken that dump of data. I got from Outlook and made it really concise. And then finally, you know, we can FlowBuilder a teams message. We could do Outlook, we can do any number of things. But in this case, I'll just say. Send an email. And I want to use again. We could use my email. I could type in my email and now that's a part of the body. I can use the again reference a prior step. And right here James be the step from it. HTML subject weekly prep. And I'll be able to continue, and I'll test this again. And now, just like that, I could turn this on. And every week I've got a nice summary sitting in my inbox and I can continue to just dial in this prompt and FlowBuilder it more valuable for me and FlowBuilder it useful. So. And any questions on that, I'll switch over gears and FlowBuilder it more specific to your team's two use cases. Does that feel like it James be easy enough for other people on the team to try to leverage. I mean, it's good. It's interesting because I did that the exact same automation with with the Microsoft workflow tool. And I would say it's maybe less powerful, but even easier. But it's a good example. Yes. To show what this feeble. And I guess you can if you have the right access. You can also interact create events in our book or in Azora Systems. Yeah, for sure. Yep, exactly right. Candidly, I think it's going to be a little complex for some of our users. I think there James be a subset of people who get it right away. I think there'll be another subset where, like, just some of the choices you were making, Jordan, were like, you obviously knew what you were doing. Like, oh, I'm going to click HTML here, I'm going to click this model, and it, you know, works better. And so I think an important thing is understanding kind of the support from your team and what that sort of coming along and training people and upskilling, like, what that model James look like, because there's always going to be a subset of people where they're like, whoa, this is kind of overwhelming and new for us. Yeah, they're busy. Busy. They're busy enough with their day job. It's harder and it's challenging to figure AutomateFlow. And, yeah, Alex James touch on that, what that looks like in one of the other slides online."

Because I think for non technical people, a lot of those choices that Jordan was making, they won't have to proactively FlowBuilder. I think in this case it makes sense to, like, go through just so we could show all the steps. But what I James often tell people, particularly people who aren't technical, is have them describe what they're trying to do and it James build out something like that."

And then come comes through and then this copilot, and we're constantly improving this, and it's gotten better and better. And it'll just know, you know? It'll ask questions like, oh, you didn't say what calendar you got it from. And what. Start where you want to start and it'll walk the person through and FlowBuilder sure it has all the information and ease and it'll actually go and build this tool. And it's, it's very useful and very helpful. I use it myself as a starting point sometimes. Yes, this part is. Is important if we want to. Route this within the organization. This pass through the James would be key. For sure. Yeah, that's great. Here. Yeah. So a combination of built in copilot. Making it as simple as talk, speaking natural language to build automations and then also with support from our team for office hours and other programs. Yes, to echo what Timmy said. I want it to be nice. I didn't see it, but it comes back to why I gave up on my own. You know, it's like when you see pro playing tennis, it seems to be easy when you start your. When you start to try yourself, it's not as easy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm awful at tennis, so that. That resonates. It's really hard. Yeah, great points. Okay, so switching gears a little bit. This is. This is. Now. We're now in AutomateFlow canvas. So a canvas you can imagine, there's a whiteboard tool we have. This is what kind of we use internally and what you guys James use to help. I think some of our best customers use it to map out what a system of zaps and tables and. The platform. We have to keep it tied and documented here. So I'll touch on license monitoring and how this might work. Inside AutomateFlow. So to start. You know, when this is the case where Sarah told us about where we have a lot of dormant licenses that go unused, and there's just a lot of cost that comes along with that and a lot of potential savings for if we can notify the team, we can understand, you know, either remove that license or get a justification for why they need to keep that license. So with AutomateFlow, we're able to do this and help automate a lot of this process to hopefully save and save a lot of money on the cost of those license that are going unused. So the way this process James work is look for a dormant license use. Look for dormant licenses James notify the user. I'll dive into these a little bit more. Notify the user of, you know, hey, your license is dormant. In two weeks or whatever time frame we want, we James remove this assignment. If you don't log in, or if you don't give us a justification, And then it checks for has there been a reactivation? And then there's a automatic deprovisioning workflow. So those are the different components of this system. Along the way, you know, we're going to track and change everything. And a AutomateFlow table. So you can imagine this is like an audit table. So as each one of those steps run within this system we built, it's going to log this in a table. So I've got a lot of data. In here. Just to help me FlowBuilder sure that as these systems are running I've got traceability and I can feel comfortable knowing what it's doing. You know, what was the user for justification? I can capture a lot of this information and it's all tied nicely into the automations directly within the AutomateFlow. Platform. So let's come back to this first one where we have dormant user, user license monitoring. So again we have that trigger where every Monday a week at 8am, go and look at X, check to see, you know, if I meet the users that have been dormant for 90 days across the tech stack. And then let's go to loop through each of those users. Check if they exist. In the table. If not, I want to go and update the table. Create a new user and then add a calculation. Right. So it's just capturing those users, and then that immediately kicks off a notification. Where as soon as that new record. So the trigger for this app is as soon as that new record in the table audit table gets added, that James be the trigger to then say, you know, go and check and see have they been notified yet? If not, Use AI by AutomateFlow in this case to craft a message like it was this application you haven't logged in for this days. FlowBuilder it really nice and structured so I don't have to think about it, and then use email to notify them. And then update the record that, hey, we just notified them and you can even send a TeamChat message to yourself saying this was done. And then it continues down the line. So I'll pause here before going and showing more of the system. But is this making sense? Any. Any questions on what you've seen so far? I think it makes sense. And I appreciate you guys building out the detailed workflow because I know that was one of our next steps for things to sit down and kind of whiteboard what this might look like. So it's great to have a starting point, even if we wanted to eventually, you know, even before we trigger this whole workflow. Have, like, an AI step with AutomateFlow, where we're analyzing some of the broad data and it's helping us uncover, like, yes, right now it's a very deterministic. Does it hit the 90 day threshold or not? But if we wanted to kind of FlowBuilder sure it's uncovering additional opportunities. Maybe it's like understanding that there are different tiers of licenses and the potential to downgrade somebody. How easy would that be to add into the workflow? Yeah, I think that's a great question. I think it. It would. The devil's in the detail for that one. It just depends on what data we have access to and what, you know, how specific we want to FlowBuilder it, so. I know, Sarah, you mentioned Benchling. There's like, those are really expensive licenses. That would probably be worth it to FlowBuilder its own flow in and of itself. To say, like, let's be really specific here. Let's put in specific prompts to go and search and check and get data and maybe build out a system just for that app where the most cost expensive app to then go and FlowBuilder a recommendation. I've seen. You know, you can get creative with, with adding an AI step here to say, you know, there's a lot of flexibility to put an output. You know, you can be generic and say, go and check. Yeah. You don't have to be as prescriptive as maybe a zap would be. From end to end, so there's room for flexibility. It's just a matter of testing and seeing, you know, what works. Given the tech stack, given what we're trying to look at. So it's all feasible. It's just something we want to test and see. Like, let's try to FlowBuilder it real and see how well it works. Hey, Jordan, two quick questions. You know, with this product and knowing what, in a general sense, what organizations need, right, for a solution like this. Do you guys have like a pre built, like just program, right for initiatives like this that would have to build everything from scratch? And also leverage some of the, you know, kind of the industry standard. Of what's available. We do. So we have a lot of templates. We have a very huge, we have a very big template library that you can be really good starting point. We do have, we all have office hours. We have a lot with tam. And an AI strategist, customer success manager would be a part of the enterprise, part of your team that gets to know your business and help build those out. So it depends on the use case, right. For whether or not the template is actually helpful. But I found there's a lot of those templates within AutomateFlow that gives you the structure and starts to recommend a lot of that."

One, in terms of, like, actually building these use cases out, like, moving you along the transformation journey, Jordan and the TAM that you're going to be working with James actually, like, build some of this, right? So, like, as you can see here, Jordan is like, laid this out. Of course, you know, when it actually hits your system, I'm sure we'll have to FlowBuilder iterations to this, but he's going to work with you to actually get this connected, get this set up. The TAMS James work with you to do that for, you know, whatever the fourth, fifth, six things. Are that you're looking to do. So in terms of, like, actually building out in the near term, that's something we, we are going to be helping you guys do. The other thing I'll flag is like, we often think about AI transformation on a more holistic level across the company, where it's like, right now, we're really focused on, hey, these are a couple of use cases that we can get off the ground for you guys that can show AutomateFlow is valuable. But we really like the metrics. We tend to think about is like, okay, what percentage of the organization can build a zap? What percentage? Of the organization has something running that is actually useful for them, and not just like running just to run or like something that they set up once, but like, how many are actually getting value from those. And that sort of AI transformation is what how we think about our partnership over, like, the medium to long term."

To be super explicit, the Tams. And one thing to note in particular, this is actually a shift in strategy for AutomateFlow. Even just this year where we are trying to think about how do we really partner with clients and companies to help them drive transformations and not just strive like specific use cases. So we can talk about like the FlowBuilder sure the mechanics of the details are aligned with what you guys are doing, but our goal is to FlowBuilder sure you actually have AI embedded in your business. Not that you have a couple of zaps running."

But my understanding is that there's monthly support that's built into the model. Right. So that would be, like, for these first two, and then there would be, like, a rate that you have. For, you know what, six additional hours of support or 12 additional hours of support a month if we wanted to move beyond these use cases and support the rest of the organization. My understanding is you have like a, you know that as part of your pricing models, is that correct?"

Has the capacity to train to, like, help you these couple of months, and then they could do those next use cases and train the team. So you should not this year based off of, like, what we've put in front of you and what you've described to us. Your, your goals are you shouldn't need additional, like, hey, we need more Jordan hours. If that's happening. It would be because, like, you know, we're growing really quickly. There's, like, high adoption. We could have a conversation around what we should do for next year at that point, but you should be good this year in terms of the support you need. Maybe. And maybe I can jump to what does that look like in practice as one of the pages I have, if that would be helpful. So the support model that we're describing, one, like I mentioned, in the first 90 days, Jordan is going to be like hands on keyboard as you like, building out these models, actually getting these stuff, getting this stuff connected. Two, and this is where the actual ongoing support happens, the monthly tam. So Francis, who has worked with a lot of different customers across these types of problems. He James be actually available to Sarah to help her build things. He James actually go away and, like, do specific automations. And then we have our AI transformation strategist who James be thinking, like, okay, what are the second, third things that you're doing, Sarah, for example? I know you had, like, a whole list of, like, additional use cases that we prioritize these two, but there's, like, additional ones down there. The AI transformation strategies can start looking forward and say, like, okay, how do we start thinking about implementing these? And then while the TAM is working on your third use case, they're thinking about your fourth. The TAM is working on their fourth. The tam. We're spending some of those hours, our office hours. Right. For you and other people on your team to come in and do some of those one off trainings. Like those hours or are there to support you as a whole? And then last and like this is more minor. We have like a group TeamChat channel where it's like us, me, Jordan, it'll be Francis, whoever our AI transformation strategist ends up being, and that James just be available like one off questions that people can ask, but that would not at all account against the like actual support hours or trainings and things that are being run. I'll pause there. From what I described, does that feel like you have what you need to be supported? If not, what would you want or need to see to feel like you have the support you need to be successful?"

But we're not, like, necessarily sitting there counting like, oh, you know, you guys are at 13 hours. So we're not going to talk to you anymore. It really is about, like, that sort of overall wrapping support.

You know, when I look at this first part where, you know, Jordan's going to be there and help us build out two use cases. Right. I think that it would like behoove AutomateFlow to. For us to have as. As much use cases, as many use cases as possible. Right. Because that's what the model is based on. Like, is there, Is there any. Any opportunity to, like, have that be part of the package that each time we come up with a use case, we get that support regardless of the monthly TAM hours? Because if we were to build out, you know, multiple use cases throughout the year, It would be great to have someone like Jordan to help us stand all of those up. Right?

I just want to FlowBuilder is that we're going to be here to support you on those kind of indifferent of whatever the like. TAM model here says, but I James go back and, like, we can try to find a way to FlowBuilder this explicit in our agreements or in our contract so that we're saying, like, hey, we James definitely help you with these additional use cases as they, as they come out. And if I understand part of what your concern is, you're like, you don't want to get a place. Get to a place, you know, six months from now where you're like, okay, we have a fourth use case. And you. You hear back from us, well, oh, that'll cost you $50-100K more dollars to do a fourth use case, right? Like. That's kind of what you're solving for.

As an example. Those where I could see if it's a little bit more complex, that we'll need a little bit more help in standing that up. Once it stood up. Right. The 12 hours monthly makes sense. And at the clip of for every 6 hours is 15k. I don't know. I don't want. I don't want to touch."

They'll just. Like, monitor them. We specifically built in the 12 to allow for some of those spikes. So I just want to. That I want to be expressed about because I think even if I go back to my, like team and say, like, hey, we want to FlowBuilder sure that we have explicit language around here that we're supporting you. On those upticks, it would likely still be 12 hours of support on the plan, if that makes sense. Sarah, anything you would add here?

That would be a failure on my end. I want to FlowBuilder sure you guys feel comfortable. Obviously, you're not going to be experts, and that's where the TAM and myself and the team can come in. But we find a lot of our customers that use AutomateFlow. We'll start to just the beauty of the advantage of our platform is being able to quickly build out and test a part of the system. To be able to quickly say, like, I can build that, it's really easy for me to find the dormant licenses and add that to a table. But maybe I'm struggling with how do I automate the deactivation piece. And that can be a separate zap, and that can be where, you know, TAM can point you in the right direction. Use this API call here, do this, or use this action that we have built in, and it becomes a lot more of a partnership and you just start to learn that by default. As you're building, experience grows and your comfort with the system grows, and you find it to be very user friendly, especially given the appetite that it sounds like is that Horizon Ventures."

Because I think those are different levels of like, training enablement. You have to do, right? Like, if you're like, hey, we want everyone in the orb to be able to build what Jordan just built. That's different than, like, oh, we want everyone the org to be able to do, like, a three step zap that, like, solves a specific problem for them. How are you guys?

I would like to be able to get everybody in a democratized way to be able to do some of the things that Jordan was initially demoing. Like, for example, you know, yesterday, Kirby, who is David's boss, And, you know, one of our he leads our enterprise applications team was telling me he would like to build an automation where it can summarize his 1200 emails in his inbox and help him prioritize into, you know, what's high, high urgency, you know, high importance versus what's low urgency, low importance. And so I think. And that's going to look different for everybody, depending on what issues they're facing. So I would like to be in a place where everyone at Horizon Ventures feels comfortable doing that, but anytime where we're involved, involving looking up data from systems or building a more complex workflow that continues to be centralized."

The only other thing I wanted to add, just Robert, based off of that example you gave, we haven't talked about it a ton just because it hasn't been like a core focus of the evaluation that we've been doing with Sarah, but we have a lot of features around what apps are available to people. So you could say, for example, hey, you can connect to Outlook and ChatGPT, but you can't connect to Bambuhr unless someone on our team approves it.

We touched on this a bit at the beginning, but I just want to, like, remake explicit that we're not trying to, like, blow up your current processes. We know that you have existing workflows on Mercado. Those are operating systems that are, like, running fine. You don't need to, like, rip and replace those to start using AutomateFlow to build these agentic workflows that Sarah's working on to do the citizen development that we're driving towards. If there's interest later in a consolidation conversation, we can have that. But, like, nothing we're doing today, nothing that's a part of this agreement is going to requires us to, like, rip out workado.

We've been talking with Sarah about targeting effectively next Friday to have like an agreement. Is that at all realistic? I guess, like, let's just say that, like, is.

Are having a discussion after this to kind of FlowBuilder sure that we're on the same page about pros and cons and, you know, strategically align. And same with you, Robert. So I think if it needs to be after next week, that's also okay. I think the reason I had been pushing kind of Alex and Jordan is to FlowBuilder sure that we're able to kind of kick some of these projects off and then FlowBuilder enough progress by March. So another way. We want to be aggressive. So we want to sign, but we need to FlowBuilder sure we.

Would it be if we can get the contract to your legal team, like today, potentially, as like, this is the standard, like agreement that you guys can start to look at, get some feedback on would the 30th be a reasonable target to work towards? And just the reason I'm trying to set like a target to work towards is because we often see for things like this, like, if there's not a date where we're all like, this is the. What we're driving towards. These things start to slip. You end up in mid February, and Sarah hasn't started building yet. That's sort of the world we're trying to avoid, if that makes sense."

Good morning. How's it going?  \nThem: Good. Good. How are you?  \nMe: Not too bad. Come on. Honestly, very excited for  \nThem: Yeah. Summit?  \nMe: offside. Summit. Yeah.  \nThem: Same. Yeah. I keep calling you to meet up or something else because my last company called us something different. I'm like, I don't Summit. Summit. Like, I work at AutomateFlow. I know what this is. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pumped. This should be fun. I just got this morning, I got a notification from Delta two. It's like, you've been upgraded to comfort plus. And I was like, sweet.  \nMe: Oh, that's nice.  \nThem: Yeah. So it's yeah. That was a good way  \nMe: Okay. Yeah. You're obviously, it's comes you're because you're flying out of Atlanta. Right?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I feel like I feel like the Delta upgrades out of Atlanta is always so difficult.  \nThem: Yeah. It for sure is. Yeah. I almost never get it. So and, like, my flight's not till Saturday. So  \nMe: I guess it also helps that probably a Saturday flight is better than if you taken, like, the Monday or Thursday flights.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Like, the flights when people are traveling for  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: work mostly. Sarah, how's it going?  \nThem: Morning. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's going well. It's so cold.  \nMe: Can't imagine. We we had a little bit of that this last week, but, things are about to normal.  \nThem: Yeah. Oh, good.  \nMe: Down here. You know?  \nThem: We're supposed to have a second storm coming this weekend maybe. So we'll see. How long have you been in Boston? Since November. So it's super recent. Okay. Where were you before that? California.  \nMe: But she  \nThem: Okay. Yeah. So this is it was all new. Ago. Yeah.  \nMe: you're three years too, though, before  \nThem: Yeah. Well, like, Alex's yeah. School and you know, it's on our first radio, but still tough to adjust. Yeah. I can only imagine. I've only been I've only lived and been in Georgia and down in in so grew up here. Yeah. Nice. But the idea of living in the North is foreign to me. So Good call. Yeah. That's for sure.  \nMe: don't want I Cool. So I I think we wanna use most of the time for actual, like, as a working session, like, dig in. But so two things I wanted to, like, just quickly align on based off of our pings yesterday. One, just one of my get concrete on what the actual criteria for the pilot are. And I can share I can share these with you as well. I think this is aligned with what we've what you would flag by kind of what we've been talking about.  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: But I FlowBuilder sure we're working towards this. And what I'd love to get to a point towards over the maybe the next couple of weeks where the leadership team has, like, seen these and Lisa, like, okay. Like, if we can check these boxes, this is something we'd feel comfortable moving forward with, if that makes sense. So, like, the citizen development piece, I think, is, like, the biggest driver here of, like, why you would go with AutomateFlow over you currently have in IntegrateHub. So if we can, like, demonstrate sort of ease of use that you can use it when we do the workshop that, the executive team can use it that James allow us to actually show value for the company And then sort of tied to that is build and speed complexity. So I think of this as like how many people can we actually get to build, and then this is like what is their what is your experience like building? So we'll like, you know, take maybe a quick before and after survey of it. How how what did people learn? What was complex? What was not? What is your opinion on the support model, like your experience working with Jordan compared to working with Kato? And then, of course, like the security and compliance pieces. In my mind, this is sort of like table stakes. Like, it is a necessity, but I think both us and Ricardo James check all of these boxes assuming, Emma's happy with that, which we should talk about a moment. And then of course, how like, it just actually how much can you actually build. In this time period. Because I think I have a hypothesis that we James have an opportunity to build more in AutomateFlow, particularly once we get, like, other people, like, doing some of these, like, personal productivity things and stuff like that over the next couple of months. I'll pause. Does this seem like the right set of things The does the and maybe the weight we we don't even need the weightings, but does this weighting seem like reasonably directly direction  \nThem: Yeah. I think  \nMe: correct?  \nThem: think that list of stuff looks good. I think for the second, I kinda think of, like, one and two as as basically different personas. Like, I agree with this in development framing. For the second one, I think of that as, like, ease of building for I IT, like, from a centralized standpoint. Like, the more complex stuff.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Might might extend beyond IT too, but, you know, just to start, like, that's really where most of our centralized development James happen. So I I would wait those two actually  \nMe: Hello?  \nThem: probably pretty evenly. And agree. Support model quality. Security and compliance is, like, we can put a percentage on it, but if it doesn't have some of the things, it's more of, a no go. So  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I think that looks good. And then platform velocity. Yeah. Maybe we can talk about, like, what the best way is to test that one. I know, like, with the leadership team session, that'll help. Even from, like, a centralized standpoint, I, like, I can start to, you know, I I feel like I'm still not up the learning curve, but I can try to build out some of the other use cases that we have to just kind of compare and contrast.  \nMe: And I saw you'd also like, you'd started doing, like, an MCP thing  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: earlier this week too. Like, some of that kind of stuff. And I think having Jordan as a resource to help you  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: build some of those things James James be good. Since Okay.  \nThem: Awesome. Yeah. That sounds good. And I I can I think Robert is the right  \nMe: That  \nThem: person to review this with and, like, yeah, it'll be, you know, important to have David and team come along the journey, but I think, like, I'll I'll fill out the eval and I think if Robert feels confident based on the eval, we'll we'll FlowBuilder the decision kind of regardless a little bit of  \nMe: 20¢.  \nThem: of some of the better? Like, there's always gonna be pros and cons.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But  \nMe: And I I think that that is sort of, like, just what we're trying to get to of, hey. Like, what what does success  \nThem: yeah,  \nMe: look like? Because in full transparency, I'm I right now don't feel like there's, a clear set of criteria where it's like, hey. Like, if we could check these boxes, then Horizon Ventures would find this valuable. And if we can get to that, I would feel I think everyone on our side would feel much better about longer term pilot. And then this is,  \nThem: Yep.  \nMe: just like metrics hoping we're hoping to track a tie to some of these. So like response time to requests. Resolution quality, how many hours actually have you worked with Jordan, how many how long does it take to complete some of the sliceless governance work, total use cases like we were talking about, internal time required. And I'm thinking about this of, like, Jordan's time versus, like, your time or the I know you guys have a IntegrateHub Sorry. I forgot his name, but he was on the call the  \nThem: Brian. Mhmm.  \nMe: Brian. And then system development is just like how many actual automations to be built, time to first log in to first working, and then the workshop participation sort of outcomes. And so we'll do, a  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: like, how how confident are you? Like, what did you what do you know about AI already? And then afterwards, we'll ask the same questions. And I think this James just help us sort of build that case to your executive team if we can point to some of these some of these things.  \nThem: Awesome. Yeah. No. That that's perfect.  \nMe: Great. Okay. Then the last, like, honestly, very, very tactical thing in terms of if we are doing an actual pilot instead of a like, like, a full contract. Went back to my team and they wanna do 20,000 for the two months, which is about 1.5 times the, like, prorated cost. And that's just, like, with Jordan's time, the investment we're making here that it derisks it slightly for us. On that. So if this is reasonable and makes sense, I can send over, like, the formal quote for this. I guess my question would be, if we, like, sent over a quote I know Emma owns the, like, legal stuff, so we would need to with her. Who else would need to, like, say yes to, like, just the the pilot quote  \nThem: Bread.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. So I can share this. I have a one on one with him tomorrow. So we can I'll talk to him about it during that call.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: And to kind of gauge his reaction. So maybe just to so that the two months because I know we're kind of in this, like, hybrid. We're doing the two week trial. I'm getting some of Jordan's time. We're  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: signed up for the session. So the two months would be, like, that formalized TAM support option. That's just the paired down version of the full year cost. Is that right?  \nMe: Yes. But transparently, the two months that'd still that'd still be with Jordan. So, like, even in the typical plan, that full month, that two months is, like, basically, you're paying for Jordan's time for those two months to actually, like, engage with you and, like, build these things.  \nThem: Okay. Cool. Cool. Gotcha. Yep. So  \nMe: And then the and then the typical model, just so, like, it's clear, the TAM then, like, picks up after, like, onboarding, and then they, like, sort of continue that. And all that kind of stuff. So  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: okay. So I I can share I'll share the basically three slides with you. I'll this a little bit based on what we just discussed. I'll share this. And then we'll share a version of this, as well. And then we James assuming, basically, our end, if Robert gives sort of like a verbal yes, we can, like, send over the quote details and, start there. And I guess the only thing I would ask is is there any way we could, like, ping Emma to have her start looking at the, security legal stuff?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: On this? I know I sent the details to her last week, but I didn't wanna, spam her on it. I don't think she's had a chance to look at it yet. Okay.  \nThem: Sounds good. Yep. I'll pull up.  \nMe: Awesome. That is me. I James shut up and let you guys actually work down.  \nThem: Alex. Let's get some real work done. Hi, Alex?  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: No. This is very important. I'm glad we started there. So sweet. So we made a lot ton of progress, Sarah. I think getting those synthetic invoice is huge, getting Alec hooked up is huge. And then I saw the ProcureSoft updates too, and was able to look at that last night a little bit this morning too. So that James be think we're making pretty quick progress. Anything else? So one of the things I wanted to show that we already have working so the data extraction. So within this is so I'm back on the Canvas. I have this temporary and this is, what this is doing is gonna allow us to start testing the data extraction. So within that table that you added, all the synthetic invoices, what it James do is go through it kicks off with a button in the table, and I'll just actually, I'll just trigger this now. So let's take this invoice so we can see, you know, this synthetic data. We just click extract data. And what that James do is it then kicks off this Zap which we'll start to see yeah. Starts to run. So it goes through, gets the data from the table, that just triggered it, and then it use uses this AI by AutomateFlow step. And so this is a you know, just a honestly, it's a prompt I had generate to say, like, just FlowBuilder up some invoice data. So I don't know if all these fields are gonna be relevant, but I just wanted this as a placeholder for us to start testing. But it seems like pretty standard fields and so you can see as it goes through, I'll click on this one. This is a record that triggered. I have the history. I can see what happens. It's gonna go through, get the invoice data, then it's going to update this table. And as soon as this runs, I'll show that. It's gonna update the table with the values it extracted. So it went through. Let's go look at it. So we have this synthetic one. So I can come here to the invoice data. View. And I'm clicking on that a lot, but I'll come back and we can look at this. So this again was the invoice, which is 1887. And now we can start to see, okay. Here's an invoice number. Here's a supplier name. Or sorry. This one up here, Fisher Science, and then there's the date, payment terms, due date. What was the currency? What's the invoice total? What's the buyer company name? We start to we can start to really, you know, kinda compare these side to side and see, you know, how does it look. Purchase order number critically if it's present. So that's that's working. And then as this continues to finish, it extracts the invoice line item. Separately. And we do this so that we can get an array or multiple line items in a single call and then that James also update this table as well. So now we can start to switch to this view, which is invoice line item view. And then this gives us like, here's kinda grouped by invoice. You know, what are the specific invoice line items for each of these. So questions on this? I know and those it's about super fast what I wanted to just show is, hey. We have something that's working. We can start to test against the synthetic data you uploaded, which is be really helpful to really dial in the prompt. And then downstream as well. Okay. No. This is helpful. So I I just wanna understand. Taking the data extraction and putting it into multiple tables. Like, there's a line item view. There's a summary data view, extract data view. What's kind of the difference? Sure. Yeah. So this is it's taking this is only one table. So there's a lot of we could restructure this, but I have it on one table. And then within AutomateFlow, you're able to create multiple views I see. Just created a new view, called it that. And this way, it's easier to say, like, I just wanna see the feel. So I hid, like, all the invoice line item fields. Down here in this view. So it's just gonna FlowBuilder it a lot easier to know, open up the PDF in one tab. And then, in this case, look at you know, what would the actual data for that invoice before looking at the line items. Okay. Gotcha. Admittedly, I'm a little I'm a little Yeah. I'm a little lost as to why so I I feel like the maybe the piece I'm not understanding is okay. Great. We have it in, like, the table view. The the second view that you just showed is for us to be able to QC. It sounds like like, in a different format. But when you when you go there, it's only showing one invoice instead of the  \nMe: That's  \nThem: 19. Is that just because we only clicked extract data for one of these? Yep. Exactly.  \nMe: right.  \nThem: Why? So I haven't run this for oh, and we can just go through and click this. Okay. So we have to manually initiate or well, eventually, just kind of run automatically for all of these? Run automatically. So I could've set up this Zap to say, you know, trigger when a new record is added to this table. Yeah. But you added those last night, so I just I didn't have this published yet, so I just added a button. Gotcha. And that'll be a good framework for us to say, like, if we wanna use a table, we don't have to use a AutomateFlow table to review before adding the ProcureSoft. Right? We could say, go look at this, and then the button could be add to ProcureSoft, which triggers another Zap that actually does the invoice creation. Gotcha. There's a lot of flexibility in how we wanna set it up. Yeah. This for now, is just kinda showing, like, what we could do to extract the data. But, yeah, we could change it to run automatically no matter what. Cool. Makes sense now. I'm following. I Yeah. So Drill out actually. Yeah. I think for the finance team, if I had to guess, their preference is probably like, just from a UI standpoint to see it and review it in ProcureSoft rather than looking at a table, like, first and then because it just adds an extra step that they're not used to. So, yeah, that's that's probably the right workflow is to, like, if it can save the in like, if it can write in the right fields, but then save it as a a draft or something Yeah. And kind of be you know, in in some way, can think about how to highlight which ones there's high confidence on and which ones there's, like, potential mismatches or or errors on. And then they kinda just have a queue, that would probably be ideal. Cool. Yeah. And that's one of my questions for Lisa because I did see in the documentation that was you can create an invoice, and then you can host it. Essentially. So it seems like ProcureSoft has some kind of natural cue, and so that would be I certainly agree. Yeah. That would be ideal if they they never have to look at AutomateFlow. And that's how you guys wanna run it. That's definitely something we could do. Okay. Cool. Cool. So we're in here. I James so that's running, and we can come back and look at this once it's done. Next thing to look at so the ProcureSoft connection. So one of the things I did notice was there was, like, an extra colon in the call, which is why you're getting that error. Oh, okay. But since updated that, but now there was an internal error that we're getting from ProcureSoft's side. When I run this, it's ProcureSoft internal error. So I wanted to see just confirm, I think, this URL and then a few setup things. So if you could if you wouldn't mind sharing your screen to see, like, in ProcureSoft admin, and then we can kinda troubleshoot this together. Sweet. And see where we end up there. Set up. Run up this in OAuth. And I is the AutomateFlow What?  \nMe: And there's no history at all, which is interesting. So that means there's not even it hasn't even, tried to FlowBuilder or, like, there was no, like, endpoint was never even hit.  \nThem: Yeah. A Horizon Ventures. Company.  \nMe: Can we try just, a curl request and just see if we can just, like, hit the endpoint even and get the, like, history to show?  \nThem: Let's see. Is it? And there's no, like this is active. There was no way to it's not just, like, you scroll up a little bit, that's it. Yeah. And scroll down. Is there anything? Is it Yeah. That's it. If it's a I mean, I could try to create a new one. I don't know.  \nMe: Could you  \nThem: This isn't just  \nMe: Oh, sorry. I was gonna say. Sorry.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I was gonna can you click into, like, maybe the work one? Just so we can see so we can see what it looks  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: what it should look like when it's running. Like, you scroll down to oh, this one also doesn't have history. So maybe there just is no history. Or do you get to click into history?  \nThem: Oh, None.  \nMe: Oh, okay. Still none.  \nThem: Weird. What's what's another one that James probably have something?  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: It just doesn't show history.  \nMe: Yeah. Maybe, that would that could FlowBuilder sense. Or is the if the in the view, is there a maybe is there a filter for, like, active at the no. Never mind. Don't worry about it. Okay. There we go. Are are there any kids to do the is the drop down? Or no. To the to the right of it? Or no?  \nThem: Oh, active is yes.  \nMe: Okay. So these are theoretically active. Never mind. You've were exhausted by  \nThem: Yeah. Okay. I think it's the  \nMe: Sorry.  \nThem: it's the grant type, I think. So it needs to be so this is I I I probably should have put question on that. But, yeah, when you create it, there are different options for grant types. So should I  \nMe: Oh, I think we want client credentials.  \nThem: choose some of these other one? Yeah.  \nMe: Right?  \nThem: Yeah. That's right. Oh, wow. And My name and login.  \nMe: So I would say, like, AutomateFlow client. We probably did delete the other one.  \nThem: Does it does it matter what we put here? I can just put my name. Yeah. Your name should be fine. I'm not working.  \nMe: And I'm not sure what it means for what does it mean for login?  \nThem: Oh,  \nMe: Here? Like, oh, like, the login to the ProcureSoft  \nThem: Yeah. I don't know. Or that could be for AutomateFlow too, for sure. Okay. I guess I'll try that. And then we want the scopes again. Yeah. Sorry. This part's gonna be a bit tedious.  \nMe: worries.  \nThem: Yeah. I can help read it too if that's helpful. But Oh, god. Do you I noticed some of these were asking for read, but not write. Mhmm. Right? Just turn those on anyway. It won't we need that if we're like, taking the information from the invoice and having it, like, prepopulate the queue? Well, we shouldn't because it's so for, like, for supplier, for example, purchase order, where we're just trying to figure out what are the active purchase orders. And then on the invoice, we're just log like, linking it to the existing purchase order, we're not creating anything new. I see. I see. Mhmm. It doesn't hurt, but, typically, best practice is just to do  \nMe: And if I understand the  \nThem: Yeah. Minimum.  \nMe: this is set up correctly, I think we can can you edit it after the fact, like, change like, change the permissions on the key? Oh, okay.  \nThem: No. It didn't look like you could. I don't think so.  \nMe: Okay. So we we I mean, if we if we have to, we'd have to create a new one, I guess, is the  \nThem: Because Yeah.  \nMe: which okay.  \nThem: Which is okay too. It's odd to me. Okay. Cool. I think that's the list. Alright. We're gonna pop so I should pop that in to what step you were referring to. Mhmm. Yeah. Is it invoice data? This one. Data. Three counts. Let's see. So this is this is a table. So if we go back to the Canvas, there's a ProcureSoft token invoice processing workflow, And then yeah. So right here, there's, like, a little one Yeah. The that that's the one. And then if you scroll up a little bit, you'll be able to open up the Zap. Yeah. And can we can also ignore the Canvas if you find it frustrating and just go to the folder and stuff. But I know. That's cool. I wanna learn how to okay. Cool. So the way the way we've kinda architected this so far is to be able to have one centralized app that is managing the token. So if we do if we do need to, change it in the future, it shouldn't be too big of a deal. At least how we how we built it so far. Well, And then this URL should stay the same. Right? That looks good. Yep. Yeah. It stays the same. And then did you update the secret? Yeah. Yep. I updated the client and the secret. And then give rid of that in the basic auth I was testing that earlier if you can clear that out as well. Just empty that field. Yep. Continue. Continue.  \nMe: I'd tell you. Let's  \nThem: Don't know.  \nMe: see.  \nThem: Bro.  \nMe: Europe.  \nThem: So you updated both the client ID and secret. F32. Yes. D No. Nothing.  \nMe: Wrap and Array, pyelotype form.  \nThem: Daughters of Do I need to update like, just the this URL is a little different? Does that matter?  \nMe: I don't think that would be the right one. Could  \nThem: Client client token. Okay. Yeah.  \nMe: Well, I guess, is that do is that the is that, like, the URL, for their API, like, the API  \nThem: Yeah. It should be. It's pretty standard. Now I'm doing some googling on the side here. Let me ping Brian too to see if he might know.  \nMe: So I think I think we need, like, a a different endpoint. I'm looking at, like, the API operators here. Me ping this in the chat. If you look at the, like, the list here, like, the endpoints are based off of, like, the type. Of, object that you're you're retrieving. Also, this is making me take for granted how much how, good some our documentation is. I just want, like, an example of an API call that works Apparently, that is not, a thing that they have on here.  \nThem: Yeah. Because I'm pretty sure we have to get the access token first before we do any direct API calls, which is what this step  \nMe: Oh, this this step is literally just  \nThem: correct. Yeah.  \nMe: is just getting the access token. Oh, okay. Sorry. That makes sense.  \nThem: No. Yeah. I'm happy to be double checked for sure. Sure. I I did it really understand what an API was until two months ago. So yeah. We're we're at different stages. You're in good hands. I yeah. None of us are developers, so we're all all in this together. Let me let me try one more thing here. Okay. There it is. Alright. I figured it out. So you have to put the scopes in as well. Which is kinda silly. So here, if you want to copy and paste this. So in the chat, Sarah, Did we go down to add value set? Which is kinda in the middle underneath client secret, There's a little yeah. That one. And then in that left box, we'll just type scope. And then you can copy and paste the ones from the Zoom chat. And that'll be the ones we just that was a list I sent you, and then click continue. And then retest. Oh,  \nMe: How's he awake? Okay. Wait. No. This is a new era, though. This is good.  \nThem: Yeah. That's an error. So maybe did I do something wrong with list that I had? Or I can just pull this. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That'd be good. Yeah. Copy and paste in there. Perfect. Should match exactly. Source of truth. I'd just be in, like, a different order or something. Oh, big money. Oh, the heck?  \nMe: Exceeds previously granted scope. Can you can you go back to the con configure? What is the you have commas. These are comma separated I'm trying to think. Like, I wonder if that is relevant, but I don't know if it should be.  \nThem: It should be fine. I think  \nMe: As a test, can we try maybe we just have one of the scopes in there Can we just try to see if what that does as, a Okay. So that one of them works. See if can add us if we can figure out if we can add a second one. Like, maybe as a comma new line.  \nThem: Or, yeah, without a, yeah, without a comma.  \nMe: Let's try that. Okay. Yeah. That's it. Need so we they need to be on new lines. No commas.  \nThem: Let's tag new lines, no commas.  \nMe: Which is  \nThem: Did those two. Look at us. Everybody's figuring it out. Go, Alex. So I James reiterate, Sarah. This is the worst part of every every iPass tool in general, but for sure, in my experience with AutomateFlow, it is always connecting to these accounts, which is Oh, yeah.  \nMe: But once we get this done, you'll never have to do it again. I mean, not with this not with this tool, I guess, is the there we go.  \nThem: Yeah. Okay. Great. This is perfect. And, again, one centralized app. And now when we do other API calls, we'll what we're doing what this is doing is putting into a what's called storage by AutomateFlow. And so it's able to save that access token that we can then access from another Zap securely and use it in the call. So we don't have to put any token directly in the webhook. We can just say use this variable that was saved through storage from this Zap over here. Okay. Gotcha. So that's best practice whenever we're configuring that step to add this after. Correct. Yep.  \nMe: Yeah. Any I would say any secrets at all. So, like, anything where it's like, hey. We don't want  \nThem: Cool.  \nMe: stored in plain text. Just, like, in a field somewhere, it would be let me see my best.  \nThem: Okay. Great. Sweet. So that was that. That's the ProcureSoft. And then so one of the things that maybe we can try while we're here, we have this access token. Did you retest this?  \nMe: The last step.  \nThem: Did this run? I did. Okay. Let's update this configure. And then, yeah, a b c so we'll get rid of that. And then click the, yeah, the back forward slash back forward slash, and then click on that three the third step. And then we'll do click on access token.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Great. And then click continue. Cool. Now we're actually storing it. Gotcha. Sweet. A b c went and got us far. Sweet. And we can publish this. Nice. We're live. Okay. We can go, and if you wanna test it, there should be there's another, webhook step if we're feeling bold where just searching for purchase orders. So,  \nMe: We go back to the  \nThem: can go back to the Canvas and find that other Zap. That'd be really cool. To see if that's working. So the all the way on the right, there's that three tiered Mhmm. Yep. And then we'll go open this, and we'll go to so the Canvas really yeah. It's just reviewing, really. Perfect. And then about that fifth step, so it's purchase orders. So the way I've started to structure this so far is you know, has would coming in, new invoice. We're ready to process it, and it's going to search for know, a, from the data we got from the invoice did we find a purchase order or not, right, the data we extracted? If yes, go down this path. If no, we need to we'll figure out the rest of that path later. But then after that, it's like, okay. We have a purchase order to work for. Let's configure this webhook. So what this is doing is taking this purchase order number, from the table that we have, and, again, we can rearchitect that. As much as we'd like. And then it's saying, it's posting and and really doing a search for an existing purchase order with this number. So we scroll down, the bearer token authorization I I'm pretty sure that's formatted right. It's still showing a b c, but that'll all change.  \nMe: think we have to can can we retest the steps above this one? Potentially or no?  \nThem: Oh, yes. The GitKoopa GitKoopa token would be the one we wanna retest.  \nMe: Okay. Yeah. There we go.  \nThem: Yep. Exactly. Well,  \nMe: And then we need to we have to retest the  \nThem: Now we got it. No.  \nMe: oh, we I guess you don't have to retest the path one explicitly. Okay.  \nThem: Since we're doing it manually, it should be fine with the yep. Continue. Cool. Now we have that.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: And let's see. How that goes.  \nMe: On test up. Let's see.  \nThem: Okay. So it didn't fail, which is good. Appeal number  \nMe: So is this a is this can we is there a way we can check-in ProcureSoft's, like, we look for this PO? Loose because this looks like it looks like it's real.  \nThem: Yeah. This was the one, the first invoice you uploaded, Sarah. That was cool. Oh, okay. Yeah. That one should be a real one. Does this work? That'd be nice. Yes.  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: Cool.  \nMe: This is weird. We it's so  \nThem: We we found one.  \nMe: we've got one. This is this is this is working. Have the we have the API connected. And so what is Jordan, could you talk talk us through sorry, Sarah. I didn't mean to I'm just this is I love this is exciting. It's it's working. Could you could you talk us through, like, what is it what what would it take to go from this level to okay, it's just dropping in running end to end.  \nThem: Yeah. So now we're very close. So the key things that makes it as for us as builders, Sarah, is, like, what we did this API endpoint. We're able to find something. But the key thing too, if you expand this step on the right, if you you can click kinda towards I'm sorry. No. The the testing window. Okay. Click into that, and then click test again. Yeah. Click and we'll see. So now we can see what data we have from ProcureSoft. Like, there's some documentation, but the nice thing is now we can see know, here's the ID of the purchase order. Here's the PO number, which we already had in this case, but we can continue to scroll down and see all this information. And so this is all really useful stuff. Not only for the most vanilla use case where we found a purchase order, now we just create an invoice and link it to this purchase order. But it's also useful to say, like, this is all data we'll have available. To then match for invoices that aren't exactly one to one. So that's useful Additionally, we looks like we have line items on this purchase order, so now we can FlowBuilder sure we're properly debiting this invoice as it's created against the right invoice line item. So it's really useful all that to say, like, now we can see what data we have. We can continue to really refine and dial in our Zap. If you scroll down like, outside of this view, we're pretty close already. I stubbed out a lot of how this flow might look. To say, you know, it's a perfect match on that far left line. And then here, what I'm doing then would be trying to we need to get the invoice line items for the purchase order and then pretty much format the text, into an invoice. So the tricky part about creating an invoice is we have to create the invoice, and we have to create the line items. We pretty much need to build the exact JSON array, if you James, of what that James look like in our one invoice post. So that'd be really where we need to dial it in and just test edge cases, but it's already pretty close for saying, like, if it's a perfect match, we find the purchase we find the purchase order. We can add it to ProcureSoft. So Okay. What about that QP? So right now, way we have it built out, like, when it when it is creating in ProcureSoft from an end user standpoint when they go into ProcureSoft, it would basically be saved in, like, a draft somewhere. If you click on invoices so I've only read about this, and I'm not using never used ProcureSoft before, but it looks like I think that status is what James happen. Because in the in the documentation, it's like, create the invoice, and then you want to release the invoice or mark it as pending approval. So I imagine yeah. I think I think putting it even as pending approval would be helpful. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Because that's filter by, I think, at the top, and then see if you can do change it to status to see what the available options are. Okay. Cool. Yeah. So I think these James be, yeah, draft. James probably be what we FlowBuilder sure we set at first. And then we can have the finance team just review those One one of the things I'll I'll do too is we can always put it in a batch, like, batch it. If we do it in multiples or even one offs just to have it send an email to you and to say, this invoice was created by AutomateFlow. Here's the number. And it was put in a draft state. So that way you don't have to go ProcureSoft. You can just get an email when it ran and go look at it. Gotcha. Or Teams message or however you'd like. Text message if you want it, but Got it. Okay. That's awesome. And James it be able to so I think when she walked me through it last time, she was saying, like, this is this is essentially the UI. Right? Like, now we're in the edit mode. So this is, like, the key part that they have to click into for the fuzzy matching. And it pulls, like, some potential PO numbers that could match. And then they it's basically like a pick list for them. So when we're searching for the the POs, I guess, it's using, like, the the back end ProcureSoft database. But the the kind of possibilities, it'll surface would it match these possibilities here? Because I'm not sure how it's Yeah. It should Ones that don't match. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see is the real answer, but the way we're extracting the data is extracting the invoice in my head. I'm and their descriptions, So I would hope 'd be able to do some kind of match Yeah. Through the API. I couldn't imagine why we wouldn't be able to.  \nMe: You know? Because this looks like this is, like, just  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: matching on, like, the name here.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: And then it seems like the first one clearly because it's the same Excuse me. Same amount and quantity.  \nThem: Okay. Yeah.  \nMe: That we're working with.  \nThem: Cool. And then for the email piece, since I now got that set up, so I'll need to go back into, like, the first one of the first steps here and FlowBuilder sure it's working. Mhmm. Yeah. You wanna do that right now? Yeah. Let me just Do it. We could demo the full flow. Box. Alright. Nope. That's David. Oh, because he has it Oh, weird. Oh oh, because he has his account connected. Mhmm. And you, the owner, James be able to see everyone's connections even if they're private. Right? So that's only for the owner and super admin of the org. Everybody else is an admin or a member. So Okay. One thing to always call out. So here, yeah, you can do just specific folder or these are all optional fields. You don't have to input any of these. So if I just want it to look up off of, like, my maintenance box and just leave It'll get the three most when you test it, it'll get the three most recent records. Likely. Cool. Great. So that's subject. Yep. Okay. Awesome. Sweet. So that's working. So then now we can and, you know, the second step of this is going to be, you does it have an attachment? Is it an invoice email? Right? That kind of thing. Okay. So if I just send myself, like, one of the dummy data invoices, right now. Yeah. So right now, this this Zap isn't published, so it won't won't do anything, but you'll have that as a new test record if you went in there and tested it. So that can be really useful when building Zaps. But it won't until we publish this, it won't do anything with that data. Okay. Cool. So yeah. That's awesome. I I'd love to test it. I just sent myself, like, a dummy data invoice. So you're saying, like, we have to now publish it, or do we need to edit anything else here before we do that? We would now need to publish it. So I've kinda well, I've kinda stubbed it out. I think it would be I know we only have four minutes left. We wouldn't be we wouldn't be able to finish this for that. One of the because one of the things I did too was I pulled out the extract invoice data from this. Or I just copied it to that table one. But we can I'd be curious because you likely get other emails Yep. With attachments even to your own personal inbox. Mhmm. So maybe we can just build a filter that's a little bit more It would just be an additional step just which we'll probably need for the AP voices to say, does it have an attachment? If yes, like, that's an easy check. Continue. Then let's actually look at the invoice. And is this a or the email, is this an actual invoice? If yes, continue as well. If not, it's Yeah. Throw it away or something else. Okay. Cool. Yeah. I mean, I can test that with, like, I can send myself a random attachment too, and we can see if that if it's working. Sweet. I'll send you a quick Loom showing, like, won't build it, but I'll just show you how to if you wanna take a stab at that, and that might be a good you know, test case. Yes. So your chance to do either. Definitely. Sweet. Well, a lot of progress. It's cool to see ProcureSoft connected. Definitely plenty to do to look at, you know, the of the purchase orders, it looked like we had all the line items. So, hopefully, we can use those purchase order line items to match it to the invoice and its line items. And then we'll be sure you know, anything that is posted for foreseeable future James be a draft. Lovely. Okay. So for the meeting with Lisa tomorrow, I'll I'll FlowBuilder sure, like, Jordan, when you send me that Loom, I I get that done. You think we would then be able to show her, like, the whole process from, like, a, you know, dummy invoice coming in to my mailbox to it recognizing it to the record and the table on the back end to, like, what it would look like in ProcureSoft? Or do you do you like, where do you where do you think we'll be along the Yeah. Let's shoot for that. I think one of the things I'll do then is just not worry about any of the edge cases or, like, the non happy paths. Like, any non happy path James just stop. Yeah. Just not worry about that. Side because we just wanna yeah. I mean, it it's only been a week. I think we just wanna kinda show her and get her initial reaction to also, like, they have this super expensive OCR tool that integrates natively that is I think it's, like, literally 100 k a year, and I told them, like, hey. I think we can to build this with AutomateFlow, and it would be, like, a lot better. But maybe kinda her thoughts on the compare and contrast. Would be helpful as well. Yeah. That would be awesome. I know. And we're using, you know, GPT five nano, which Okay. Because it's, you know, AutomateFlow managed for free, we have a contract with them. And you know, any enterprise client, like, it's all Yeah. But if you have your own keys, then you can use the late Horizon Ventures model. And our the extraction gets even better. Oh, yeah. Let's do that. So I would put in, our e p which step of the Zap So any is it any AI step where I just add the or API key? Yeah. Or you can go to yeah, any if you go to, the invoice process. Okay. Yep. I'm in the Sorry. Yeah. So in here, So not in this one. There's, text extraction. This one, it it'd be to more to the right. Okay. Oh, maybe I didn't add it to the Canvas. That's silly. Okay. So Zaps. Yep. Perfect. I have Okay. This would be the temp extract data from PDFs. Okay. Cool. And then AI by AutomateFlow. Yep. Gotcha. Oh, sorry. You have to edit the Zap. First. This one is published, so we're since it was just pulling from the table and putting back to the table. I'll choose the the next step, the AI by AutomateFlow. Oh, oh, whoops. Yeah. What did I That's good. All our all our all our steps are all orange, so it's a little deceiving. So you can do oh, it looks like you already have you already connect your own credentials? Probably. Perfect. So now it's just there. So it's available in any one of these AI buys after your steps, and so now this James go directly through your your connection with ChatGPT and that's it. Awesome. Finish. Yeah. Think it's gonna be meaningfully different with a different, like, API. So we have, like, Gemini API as well or, you know, access to other models through Bedrock. I know, like, sometimes the there can be a bit of a performance difference. Is that is that even worth testing here, you think? Or I don't think so. So I did use GPT four, like, dye to it was four nano, and it was kinda missing a few things. But as soon as I did five and just, like, ran it four or five times, it was perfect every time. So I think you know, usually, what I talk about is, like, Gemini has the biggest context window. So if you're pro processing a ton of data, like, that's likely the one you wanna use. But for this use case, at this end of the spectrum, it's once you get to these leading models, it's likely not gonna show a difference. But  \nMe: Like if we if we are doing more complex, like, agentic  \nThem: with the date  \nMe: steps or, like, doing more chain of thoughts or, like, connect different things. Like, the different models are better at different types of tool calls and stuff like that. But for something where it's just, like, Look at this document. Summarize it. Pull out a few facts. To Jordan's point. All gonna be pretty similar.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. For the for the two month pilot, I think one of the other use cases that I know Jordan might gave you a heads up on this already, but the one where it's pulling from brand folder in a using some sort of, like, Google or probably Google Vision AI API or something in that workflow to do the facial recognition I think that would be a really good next one to work on in that two month pilot. Yeah. I love that. I think that'd be fun.  \nMe: Could you could you expand just a little bit when you say  \nThem: Awesome. Yeah.  \nMe: like, do the facial recognition? So, like, there's a brand folder And maybe, actually, if you guys have already talked about it, made them we don't need to  \nThem: No. No. No. I I we haven't talked about it at length. So, basically, they use brand folder as their digital asset management system. So they upload all of their, like, content and branding assets to it  \nMe: Oh, wait.  \nThem: logos,  \nMe: Hold on a tool.  \nThem: Yeah. It's  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: yeah. Yeah. It's a smart sheet.  \nMe: Sure.  \nThem: Tool. It's like a  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: a software. And then they they put, like, all of their event photos in their too. This is the comms team. And then every time they have to upload a photo, it's like they manually go in and tag every single one. So they wanted to be able to do a couple things like batch tagging, ideally, facial who's in the photo. So if our CEO is in the photo and not having to, like, manually go through and find every single one where, like, he's there. So if if, like, somebody asks for a press kit, they're just like, well, here here you go. Here are all the photos tagged as our CEO, and pull them together. And then there's a often, like, a bunch of queries that they have to do. So that's why I was testing the brand folder MCP for, but we're just running into, like, a bunch of payload issues. I don't know if setting it up, like, as a Zap manually versus leveraging the MCP would help us get around some of those payload. Constraints. But I know, like, out of the box, that MCP obviously doesn't connect to the the vision portion of it. So that's not, like, a feature that's available. So I was wondering if we could build something like that. Yeah. I think that'd be really cool. And even with there's creative ways to get around that with MCP where we either it's a beta or you're able to trigger a Zap through the MCP. So then, like, a Zap can run more reliably and with more dialed in. Yeah. Is  \nMe: You talk about what the what was prompting you to use MCP for this? Was it just kind of, like, test trying to, like, test it versus you're, like, specifically MCP needed to be used for this?  \nThem: Yeah. And they don't care about the UI be honest. So we, like, we I think our team had started building something in like, a custom GPT, and it wasn't working well. And then when I I was like, well, let me just see if there is an MCP and, like, how much it has turned on in there. And then I found the AutomateFlow hosted one, so I was like, okay. Let's let's test it. And, you know, it it was work it's working for, like, very  \nMe: Sure.  \nThem: simple, like, constrained purchase, but it's not like that that diminishes the utility by a lot for the team. Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah. Click some.  \nThem: Because they all, like, wanna constrain it that much. So Yeah.  \nMe: Makes sense. Okay. Cool. And I I think, honestly, that's been my experience with MCP in general. It's it's really designed for, like, the minimum viable use cases kind of across the board. So once you're getting into anything more complex, either you have to, like, do your own custom ones or to Jordan's point, like, trigger SaaS from an MCP or something like that. But this should be something that we can that should be doable over the next twelve months, we can talk throughout logistics and all that jazz. After we  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: work through this invoice one. Cool?  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Cool. Thanks, guys. Sarah, I James send, over in the next couple of hours those couple of slides that we were talking about, and then we'll be on the lookout to from you for, like, a verbal, like, thumbs up, thumbs down from Robert after your conversation yesterday and assuming he says, yes, I'll send we can send over the quote and all jazz and, like, sign and stuff.  \nThem: Sounds good. And, Jordan, I James see you tomorrow, and maybe we can figure out, more working time next week to kind of continue. But thank you so much  \nMe: Great.  \nThem: both of you. Really awesome, like, exciting progress and yeah.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Funny. Got got the cable connection going. We're  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: there. Yeah. Bye, guys. Have a good weekend.  \nThem: I a good one. See you. To you later.  \nMe: Great. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/...

Like, if we can check these boxes, this is something we'd feel comfortable moving forward with, if that makes sense. So, like, the citizen development piece, I think, is, like, the biggest driver here of, like, why you would go with AutomateFlow over you currently have in IntegrateHub. So if we can, like, demonstrate sort of ease of use that you can use it when we do the workshop that, the executive team can use it that James allow us to actually show value for the company And then sort of tied to that is build and speed complexity. So I think of this as like how many people can we actually get to build, and then this is like what is their what is your experience like building? So we'll like, you know, take maybe a quick before and after survey of it. How how what did people learn? What was complex? What was not? What is your opinion on the support model, like your experience working with Jordan compared to working with Kato? And then, of course, like the security and compliance pieces. In my mind, this is sort of like table stakes. Like, it is a necessity, but I think both us and Ricardo James check all of these boxes assuming, Emma's happy with that, which we should talk about a moment. And then of course, how like, it just actually how much can you actually build. In this time period. Because I think I have a hypothesis that we James have an opportunity to build more in AutomateFlow, particularly once we get, like, other people, like, doing some of these, like, personal productivity things and stuff like that over the next couple of months. I'll pause. Does this seem like the right set of things The does the and maybe the weight we we don't even need the weightings, but does this weighting seem like reasonably directly direction"

I think getting those synthetic invoice is huge, getting Alec hooked up is huge. And then I saw the ProcureSoft updates too, and was able to look at that last night a little bit this morning too. So that James be think we're making pretty quick progress. Anything else? So one of the things I wanted to show that we already have working so the data extraction. So within this is so I'm back on the Canvas. I have this temporary and this is, what this is doing is gonna allow us to start testing the data extraction. So within that table that you added, all the synthetic invoices, what it James do is go through it kicks off with a button in the table, and I'll just actually, I'll just trigger this now. So let's take this invoice so we can see, you know, this synthetic data. We just click extract data. And what that James do is it then kicks off this Zap which we'll start to see yeah. Starts to run. So it goes through, gets the data from the table, that just triggered it, and then it use uses this AI by AutomateFlow step. And so this is a you know, just a honestly, it's a prompt I had generate to say, like, just FlowBuilder up some invoice data. So I don't know if all these fields are gonna be relevant, but I just wanted this as a placeholder for us to start testing. But it seems like pretty standard fields and so you can see as it goes through, I'll click on this one. This is a record that triggered. I have the history. I can see what happens. It's gonna go through, get the invoice data, then it's going to update this table. And as soon as this runs, I'll show that. It's gonna update the table with the values it extracted. So it went through. Let's go look at it. So we have this synthetic one. So I can come here to the invoice data. View. And I'm clicking on that a lot, but I'll come back and we can look at this. So this again was the invoice, which is 1887. And now we can start to see, okay. Here's an invoice number. Here's a supplier name. Or sorry. This one up here, Fisher Science, and then there's the date, payment terms, due date. What was the currency? What's the invoice total? What's the buyer company name? We start to we can start to really, you know, kinda compare these side to side and see, you know, how does it look. Purchase order number critically if it's present. So that's that's working. And then as this continues to finish, it extracts the invoice line item. Separately. And we do this so that we can get an array or multiple line items in a single call and then that James also update this table as well. So now we can start to switch to this view, which is invoice line item view. And then this gives us like, here's kinda grouped by invoice. You know, what are the specific invoice line items for each of these. So questions on this? I know and those it's about super fast what I wanted to just show is, hey. We have something that's working. We can start to test against the synthetic data you uploaded, which is be really helpful to really dial in the prompt. And then downstream as well. Okay. No. This is helpful. So I I just wanna understand. Taking the data extraction and putting it into multiple tables. Like, there's a line item view. There's a summary data view, extract data view. What's kind of the difference? Sure. Yeah. So this is it's taking this is only one table. So there's a lot of we could restructure this, but I have it on one table. And then within AutomateFlow, you're able to create multiple views I see. Just created a new view, called it that. And this way, it's easier to say, like, I just wanna see the feel. So I hid, like, all the invoice line item fields. Down here in this view. So it's just gonna FlowBuilder it a lot easier to know, open up the PDF in one tab. And then, in this case, look at you know, what would the actual data for that invoice before looking at the line items. Okay. Gotcha. Admittedly, I'm a little I'm a little Yeah. I'm a little lost as to why so I I feel like the maybe the piece I'm not understanding is okay. Great. We have it in, like, the table view. The the second view that you just showed is for us to be able to QC. It sounds like like, in a different format. But when you when you go there, it's only showing one invoice instead of the"

So we have to manually initiate or well, eventually, just kind of run automatically for all of these? Run automatically. So I could've set up this Zap to say, you know, trigger when a new record is added to this table. Yeah. But you added those last night, so I just I didn't have this published yet, so I just added a button. Gotcha. And that'll be a good framework for us to say, like, if we wanna use a table, we don't have to use a AutomateFlow table to review before adding the ProcureSoft. Right? We could say, go look at this, and then the button could be add to ProcureSoft, which triggers another Zap that actually does the invoice creation. Gotcha. There's a lot of flexibility in how we wanna set it up. Yeah. This for now, is just kinda showing, like, what we could do to extract the data. But, yeah, we could change it to run automatically no matter what. Cool. Makes sense now. I'm following. I Yeah. So Drill out actually. Yeah. I think for the finance team, if I had to guess, their preference is probably like, just from a UI standpoint to see it and review it in ProcureSoft rather than looking at a table, like, first and then because it just adds an extra step that they're not used to. So, yeah, that's that's probably the right workflow is to, like, if it can save the in like, if it can write in the right fields, but then save it as a a draft or something Yeah. And kind of be you know, in in some way, can think about how to highlight which ones there's high confidence on and which ones there's, like, potential mismatches or or errors on. And then they kinda just have a queue, that would probably be ideal. Cool. Yeah. And that's one of my questions for Lisa because I did see in the documentation that was you can create an invoice, and then you can host it. Essentially. So it seems like ProcureSoft has some kind of natural cue, and so that would be I certainly agree. Yeah. That would be ideal if they they never have to look at AutomateFlow. And that's how you guys wanna run it. That's definitely something we could do. Okay. Cool. Cool. So we're in here. I James so that's running, and we can come back and look at this once it's done. Next thing to look at so the ProcureSoft connection. So one of the things I did notice was there was, like, an extra colon in the call, which is why you're getting that error. Oh, okay. But since updated that, but now there was an internal error that we're getting from ProcureSoft's side. When I run this, it's ProcureSoft internal error. So I wanted to see just confirm, I think, this URL and then a few setup things. So if you could if you wouldn't mind sharing your screen to see, like, in ProcureSoft admin, and then we can kinda troubleshoot this together. Sweet. And see where we end up there. Set up. Run up this in OAuth. And I is the AutomateFlow What?"

Well, we shouldn't because it's so for, like, for supplier, for example, purchase order, where we're just trying to figure out what are the active purchase orders.

Is it invoice data? This one. Data. Three counts. Let's see. So this is this is a table. So if we go back to the Canvas, there's a ProcureSoft token invoice processing workflow, And then yeah. So right here, there's, like, a little one Yeah. The that that's the one. And then if you scroll up a little bit, you'll be able to open up the Zap. Yeah. And can we can also ignore the Canvas if you find it frustrating and just go to the folder and stuff. But I know. That's cool. I wanna learn how to okay. Cool. So the way the way we've kinda architected this so far is to be able to have one centralized app that is managing the token. So if we do if we do need to, change it in the future, it shouldn't be too big of a deal. At least how we how we built it so far. Well, And then this URL should stay the same. Right? That looks good. Yep. Yeah. It stays the same. And then did you update the secret? Yeah. Yep. I updated the client and the secret. And then give rid of that in the basic auth I was testing that earlier if you can clear that out as well. Just empty that field. Yep. Continue. Continue."

So you have to put the scopes in as well. Which is kinda silly. So here, if you want to copy and paste this. So in the chat, Sarah, Did we go down to add value set? Which is kinda in the middle underneath client secret, There's a little yeah. That one. And then in that left box, we'll just type scope. And then you can copy and paste the ones from the Zoom chat.

And then we'll go open this, and we'll go to so the Canvas really yeah. It's just reviewing, really. Perfect. And then about that fifth step, so it's purchase orders. So the way I've started to structure this so far is you know, has would coming in, new invoice. We're ready to process it, and it's going to search for know, a, from the data we got from the invoice did we find a purchase order or not, right, the data we extracted? If yes, go down this path. If no, we need to we'll figure out the rest of that path later. But then after that, it's like, okay. We have a purchase order to work for. Let's configure this webhook. So what this is doing is taking this purchase order number, from the table that we have, and, again, we can rearchitect that. As much as we'd like. And then it's saying, it's posting and and really doing a search for an existing purchase order with this number. So we scroll down, the bearer token authorization I I'm pretty sure that's formatted right. It's still showing a b c, but that'll all change."

Here's the PO number, which we already had in this case, but we can continue to scroll down and see all this information. And so this is all really useful stuff. Not only for the most vanilla use case where we found a purchase order, now we just create an invoice and link it to this purchase order. But it's also useful to say, like, this is all data we'll have available. To then match for invoices that aren't exactly one to one. So that's useful Additionally, we looks like we have line items on this purchase order, so now we can FlowBuilder sure we're properly debiting this invoice as it's created against the right invoice line item. So it's really useful all that to say, like, now we can see what data we have. We can continue to really refine and dial in our Zap. If you scroll down like, outside of this view, we're pretty close already. I stubbed out a lot of how this flow might look. To say, you know, it's a perfect match on that far left line. And then here, what I'm doing then would be trying to we need to get the invoice line items for the purchase order and then pretty much format the text, into an invoice. So the tricky part about creating an invoice is we have to create the invoice, and we have to create the line items. We pretty much need to build the exact JSON array, if you James, of what that James look like in our one invoice post. So that'd be really where we need to dial it in and just test edge cases, but it's already pretty close for saying, like, if it's a perfect match, we find the purchase we find the purchase order. We can add it to ProcureSoft. So Okay. What about that QP? So right now, way we have it built out, like, when it when it is creating in ProcureSoft from an end user standpoint when they go into ProcureSoft, it would basically be saved in, like, a draft somewhere. If you click on invoices so I've only read about this, and I'm not using never used ProcureSoft before, but it looks like I think that status is what James happen. Because in the in the documentation, it's like, create the invoice, and then you want to release the invoice or mark it as pending approval. So I imagine yeah. I think I think putting it even as pending approval would be helpful. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Because that's filter by, I think, at the top, and then see if you can do change it to status to see what the available options are. Okay. Cool. Yeah. So I think these James be, yeah, draft. James probably be what we FlowBuilder sure we set at first. And then we can have the finance team just review those One one of the things I'll I'll do too is we can always put it in a batch, like, batch it. If we do it in multiples or even one offs just to have it send an email to you and to say, this invoice was created by AutomateFlow. Here's the number. And it was put in a draft state. So that way you don't have to go ProcureSoft. You can just get an email when it ran and go look at it. Gotcha. Or Teams message or however you'd like. Text message if you want it, but Got it. Okay. That's awesome. And James it be able to so I think when she walked me through it last time, she was saying, like, this is this is essentially the UI. Right? Like, now we're in the edit mode. So this is, like, the key part that they have to click into for the fuzzy matching. And it pulls, like, some potential PO numbers that could match. And then they it's basically like a pick list for them. So when we're searching for the the POs, I guess, it's using, like, the the back end ProcureSoft database. But the the kind of possibilities, it'll surface would it match these possibilities here? Because I'm not sure how it's Yeah. It should Ones that don't match. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see is the real answer, but the way we're extracting the data is extracting the invoice in my head. I'm and their descriptions, So I would hope 'd be able to do some kind of match Yeah. Through the API. I couldn't imagine why we wouldn't be able to."

          "text": "Cool. And then for the email piece, since I now got that set up, so I'll need to go back into, like, the first one of the first steps here and FlowBuilder sure it's working. Mhmm. Yeah. You wanna do that right now? Yeah. Let me just Do it. We could demo the full flow. Box. Alright. Nope. That's David. Oh, because he has it Oh, weird. Oh oh, because he has his account connected. Mhmm. And you, the owner, James be able to see everyone's connections even if they're private. Right? So that's only for the owner and super admin of the org. Everybody else is an admin or a member. So Okay. One thing to always call out. So here, yeah, you can do just specific folder or these are all optional fields. You don't have to input any of these. So if I just want it to look up off of, like, my maintenance box and just leave It'll get the three most when you test it, it'll get the three most recent records. Likely. Cool. Great. So that's subject. Yep. Okay. Awesome. Sweet. So that's working. So then now we can and, you know, the second step of this is going to be, you does it have an attachment? Is it an invoice email? Right? That kind of thing. Okay. So if I just send myself, like, one of the dummy data invoices, right now. Yeah. So right now, this this Zap isn't published, so it won't won't do anything, but you'll have that as a new test record if you went in there and tested it. So that can be really useful when building Zaps. But it won't until we publish this, it won't do anything with that data. Okay. Cool. So yeah. That's awesome. I I'd love to test it. I just sent myself, like, a dummy data invoice. So you're saying, like, we have to now publish it, or do we need to edit anything else here before we do that? We would now need to publish it. So I've kinda well, I've kinda stubbed it out. I think it would be I know we only have four minutes left. We wouldn't be we wouldn't be able to finish this for that. One of the because one of the things I did too was I pulled out the extract invoice data from this. Or I just copied it to that table one. But we can I'd be curious because you likely get other emails Yep. With attachments even to your own personal inbox. Mhmm. So maybe we can just build a filter that's a little bit more It would just be an additional step just which we'll probably need for the AP voices to say, does it have an attachment? If yes, like, that's an easy check. Continue. Then let's actually look at the invoice. And is this a or the email, is this an actual invoice? If yes, continue as well. If not, it's Yeah. Throw it away or something else. Okay. Cool. Yeah. I mean, I can test that with, like, I can send myself a random attachment too, and we can see if that if it's working. Sweet. I'll send you a quick Loom showing, like, won't build it, but I'll just show you how to if you wanna take a stab at that, and that might be a good you know, test case. Yes. So your chance to do either. Definitely. Sweet. Well, a lot of progress. It's cool to see ProcureSoft connected. Definitely plenty to do to look at, you know, the of the purchase orders, it looked like we had all the line items. So, hopefully, we can use those purchase order line items to match it to the invoice and its line items. And then we'll be sure you know, anything that is posted for foreseeable future James be a draft. Lovely. Okay. So for the meeting with Lisa tomorrow, I'll I'll FlowBuilder sure, like, Jordan, when you send me that Loom, I I get that done. You think we would then be able to show her, like, the whole process from, like, a, you know, dummy invoice coming in to my mailbox to it recognizing it to the record and the table on the back end to, like, what it would look like in ProcureSoft? Or do you do you like, where do you where do you think we'll be along the Yeah. Let's shoot for that. I think one of the things I'll do then is just not worry about any of the edge cases or, like, the non happy paths. Like, any non happy path James just stop. Yeah. Just not worry about that. Side because we just wanna yeah. I mean, it it's only been a week. I think we just wanna kinda show her and get her initial reaction to also, like, they have this super expensive OCR tool that integrates natively that is I think it's, like, literally 100 k a year, and I told them, like, hey. I think we can to build this with AutomateFlow, and it would be, like, a lot better. But maybe kinda her thoughts on the compare and contrast. Would be helpful as well. Yeah. That would be awesome. I know. And we're using, you know, GPT five nano, which Okay. Because it's, you know, AutomateFlow managed for free, we have a contract with them. And you know, any enterprise client, like, it's all Yeah. But if you have your own keys, then you can use the late Horizon Ventures model. And our the extraction gets even better. Oh, yeah. Let's do that. So I would put in, our e p which step of the Zap So any is it any AI step where I just add the or API key? Yeah. Or you can go to yeah, any if you go to, the invoice process. Okay. Yep. I'm in the Sorry. Yeah. So in here, So not in this one. There's, text extraction. This one, it it'd be to more to the right. Okay. Oh, maybe I didn't add it to the Canvas. That's silly. Okay. So Zaps. Yep. Perfect. I have Okay. This would be the temp extract data from PDFs. Okay. Cool. And then AI by AutomateFlow. Yep. Gotcha. Oh, sorry. You have to edit the Zap. First. This one is published, so we're since it was just pulling from the table and putting back to the table. I'll choose the the next step, the AI by AutomateFlow. Oh, oh, whoops. Yeah. What did I That's good. All our all our all our steps are all orange, so it's a little deceiving. So you can do oh, it looks like you already have you already connect your own credentials? Probably. Perfect. So now it's just there. So it's available in any one of these AI buys after your steps, and so now this James go directly through your your connection with ChatGPT and that's it. Awesome. Finish. Yeah. Think it's gonna be meaningfully different with a different, like, API. So we have, like, Gemini API as well or, you know, access to other models through Bedrock. I know, like, sometimes the there can be a bit of a performance difference. Is that is that even worth testing here, you think? Or I don't think so. So I did use GPT four, like, dye to it was four nano, and it was kinda missing a few things. But as soon as I did five and just, like, ran it four or five times, it was perfect every time. So I think you know, usually, what I talk about is, like, Gemini has the biggest context window. So if you're pro processing a ton of data, like, that's likely the one you wanna use. But for this use case, at this end of the spectrum, it's once you get to these leading models, it's likely not gonna show a difference. But"

And then every time they have to upload a photo, it's like they manually go in and tag every single one.

So if our CEO is in the photo and not having to, like, manually go through and find every single one where, like, he's there. So if if, like, somebody asks for a press kit, they're just like, well, here here you go. Here are all the photos tagged as our CEO, and pull them together. And then there's a often, like, a bunch of queries that they have to do. So that's why I was testing the brand folder MCP for, but we're just running into, like, a bunch of payload issues. I don't know if setting it up, like, as a Zap manually versus leveraging the MCP would help us get around some of those payload. Constraints. But I know, like, out of the box, that MCP obviously doesn't connect to the the vision portion of it. So that's not, like, a feature that's available. So I was wondering if we could build something like that. Yeah. I think that'd be really cool. And even with there's creative ways to get around that with MCP where we either it's a beta or you're able to trigger a Zap through the MCP.

And there's some stuff that we can, I think, show you in terms of where we're at, but then also a bunch of questions that we have? But, yeah, I I James everyone here knows me, so maybe, like, Jordan, Alex, Lisa, I'll let you guys do intros to each other. Sure. Yeah. Lisa, why don't you kick us off? I'm happy to happy to do that. So I've been with Horizon Ventures for almost eight years. I oversee all the accounts payable for all the Lab companies and Pioneering Medicines. I had purchasing at one time as well. And I finally handed that off last year. So I'm a little happy about that. But but we just started using ProcureSoft, so I'm hoping to try to streamline the process a little bit for my team because we process a lot of volume here. For all these companies. So there's, I think, 52 or 54 companies in our portfolio right now that we do payables for. So it's it's a very busy Mhmm. Yeah. I can really imagine. Well, that's great. It's good to meet you. I'm I'm the solution taker here. At AutomateFlow, so I get to help a lot of customers with, you know, designing and building Zaps in different workflows. To, you know, automate their process as much as possible. So I I love doing it. Love building. And excited to kinda talk to you today and show you what we have. Okay.  \nMe: And my name is Alex. I'm the account executive, on the AutomateFlow side. So just kind of helping coordinate the conversation between both  \nThem: Sounds good.  \nMe: of our teams.  \nThem: Sweet. Well, Sarah, do you want me to show and drive and we'll kinda go from there? Be great. Yeah. So leave it in the hands of the experts. Because I'm probably gonna mess it up. Cool. Well, no worries at all. I James let me share my screen. I'm I'm ready this time. Whereas last time, I couldn't use it with Microsoft Teams, but so, Lisa, what we have, I think, Sarah took some notes last time you guys talked and passed these along here. A lot going on with ProcureSoft, and you mentioned ProcureSoft's relatively is newish. How long have you guys been using long have you been using ProcureSoft? So we we did it in three waves. And the final wave went live September. So we're about, like, four months in with all the lab companies. Pioneering Medicines. I I think we've we've gotten a good grasp on it at this point, but there there are like, little weird nuances here and there. But just trying to go through the new flow in in the system. So it's been about four months, so I'm assuming. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah. That that's all the context. And so what we heard a lot of the big pain points around, just to recap, You'll know them well. It's manually having to input invoices, know, looking at the PDF in another window, manually inputting that. And then understanding and trying to match it to an existing purchase order or find the right purchase order. And line up and getting all that done. I think there's some other things around with repetitive invoices processing. And trying to do a lot with managing exceptions in in different policies. When yeah. And a number of things come in with the invoices for for this. So I'm curious just before I show what we have and we'll dive into some questions. What what do you feel like is your top of mind for your biggest wish list item or, like, or maybe even if it's easier, what's your biggest pain point today? With ProcureSoft or or for your team? It's not so much, like, processing wise. I mean, my team kind of adapts pretty quickly. Like, we have some veterans on my team, so we we kind of adapt to changes very quickly. It's it's mostly just vendor issues that we we've been having a a lot with. I and I hope fully the system can FlowBuilder things a little bit better. But it it's just the volume is is kind of, like, just trying to with it. Yep. Yeah. That makes sense. And the volume being, like, like, just the amount of invoices to input and to tie out to purchase orders, that kinda So so I'm I'm gonna give you, like, an example. So, like, a lot of repetitive invoices. So, like, Thermo Fisher Financial, we probably get about a 100 to a 150 invoices a month, and it's, like, individual invoices, same contract amounts, every single month, and we literally have to copy a previous invoice, enter it. And you know what I mean? Like, we can eliminate having to do that at all, like, that to me would be, like, huge. Right? So it'd save much more time. So Awesome. Well, great great use case. Great example. Thanks for that. Enough enough questions. So this is this is AutomateFlow. We're where we are right now, and I'm kinda zooming it out, but this is just like a whiteboarding tool, essentially. That we have internally at AutomateFlow. And AutomateFlow is made up of things called Zaps, which are, you know, you can imagine that everything has a trigger. You know, when this happens, do this. Right? And you have actions along the way that are are executing and we also have filtering within an automation. So it's very hopefully, user friendly to build out an automation. We have tables as well to you think of this just like an Excel, Google Sheet, or just a normal table. And, we have some agents tripped in as well. So that's just some context, but one of the things that we have working today are already so today that we have and I walk through this example here where we have right now, it's it's monitoring off of we had it linked up to Sarah's inbox. So it is saying, you know, when a new we have a trigger that's set up to say when a new email comes in with an attached it James start it'll kick off this automation. So it goes through and it says, you know, check. Is this a is the attachment a PDF? Sarah, this was something I added yesterday just after seeing all the errors come through. And maybe I'll show what first question for you, Lisa. Is it always coming in with PDF attachments, or are they sometimes, like, in the body of the email or some weird format? It come yeah. It come usually, top is always PDF. Secondary, it might be a Word doc. And then thirdly, it might be in the body of the email. So Okay. But in reality, it should always be a PDF. Yep. Cool. Yeah. Great question. Sweet. Yeah. So those emails come in. We'll do a check, and we can update this to accommodate all three two different file types, and then looking at the body too. That can be another look at that. But it comes in, looks at the PDF, and then we have, AI by AutomateFlow step built into this, and it's just using OpenAI. And it is able to extract the data from the file, It would do the same thing if it's a Word doc or if it's in a body. Then it gives us an output of fields so that we can then use down the line. So in this case, it's checking, hey. Is this a actual invoice? Because maybe these I imagine your AP inboxes get other emails with potentially attachments that aren't invoices. Is that right? Yep. Yep. Yeah. In this case, it's looking and reading the and here was one that I think Sarah ran through, and it said you know, this was an email that came in. And this was just a yeah. One of the meetings, and then it filtered it out and said stop because it was not the right thing. Here's the AI by AutomateFlow. So is this an invoice? False. And so we just stopped this automation and doesn't continue. So then from here, it extracts the invoice data. Which, if I come back in we can show here's some examples here. We've we've had this tested on a few different invoices just to see, like, how reliable is it. This is something we'll took, like, Lisa, the, I think you uploaded twenty. I made them like, I had AI do dummy data. So, like, take out any sensitive info, but just, like, replace all the numbers and stuff. And we have been using them to kinda test this functionality, so that's Jordan's referring to here. Okay. Yep. So then the example here of that would be this table, which, like, so here is the synthetic, you know, 19. This is one of the ones that just kinda dummy data. And we can start to see we have a structured output from this PDF. Of here's the invoice numbers, the supplier name, invoice date, payment due date. When don't know if there's any payment terms or currency specified. So we can start to really extract data automatically from this, and this James be we can just monitor and dial in over time. To see, you know, did this work? If not, you know, where where is it falling short? How reliable is it? But what we've seen with our first initial very admittedly small subset, with five. It is very good at this, and extracting data and putting it into structured fields. So so that continues the process. It it looks at the invoice header data, and then, critically, it gets it also does the same thing with the line items. So in this case, we're doing what's called a loop inside AutomateFlow, which just saying, you know, if it's got two line items or if it's got 10, it James do run this over and over for however many line items it has. And then upload that again to a table to save that extracted data. So I know you guys I think you mentioned you're using an OCR today. Have there been any issues or or no? Not yet? Mhmm. Yeah. Evaluating. As part of this pilot Cool. And has there been I I mean, I guess beyond just is it does it work reliably? Is there any kind of, like, wish list on the OCR or is it just looking at these AP invoices? I believe so. Yes. K. Or that would be what it would be used for. Yep. Yep. Invoices, credit memos, would probably be the main two. We OCR and our in our previous system before we went to ProcureSoft, and, it was literally reading just invoice data, like invoice header information, total invoice, all that stuff. But that was all it was doing. Okay. Yeah. And this would be something too, like, if you wanted to do a bigger test, just for to carve out that OCR separately. Like, this the nice thing about this, and I think we Sarah's seen this where you can it's as flexible as you want with just natural language. So coming here with this app, and just said, like, hey. Look for you know, the number of I don't know, a line item, decimal amount. I could sense. You could put that in here, it would start to look for that. And then put that in Additionally, I'll put that in structured data. So it's really flexible as well. Okay. So the Where does the data go after it goes through this search? Are you getting to that? I'm sorry. I'm just trying to Like Yep. Exactly right. So, yeah, this is the first part of the system where says we got a new invoice from the inbox. Now it's going to save it inside a AutomateFlow table. And then this would be, you know, where we want to go and say, let's switch to this switch to this view. And so now what we can do is, like, look at all these you know, take this invoice, for example. We have the PDF. Side by side in the table, and we also have all the files the fields that's extracted so that if you wanted to review it, you know, especially as we start testing this more, it would be let us review it before we say, hey. Kick off the final Zap or the second Zap, which is actually going to try to create an invoice inside ProcureSoft. A matching But I think the so this table, to to me, is more of, like, what we use as we're building this out to test it. And, Lisa, like, once we have this up and running, you know, live, it could be something where, like, we audit it once in a while we can figure out, like, what that looks like from the IT perspective. Just to FlowBuilder sure that it's doing those things properly. But from, like, an end user standpoint for you and your team, we're building this out so that it creates the queue directly in ProcureSoft. So you guys won't have to look at a separate data source. It'll just go in there. Yep. Perfect. Yeah. That's awesome. Right. So then, you know, while we're doing the pilot, so this is really the the bread and butter of this you know, of this automation where now we can really start to and we'll continue to build out this Zap over time. But what it'll do now is, know, I think as Sarah mentioned, it's we're getting triggered from that table, but ultimately, long term, it'll just run automatically as we extract the data. It'll start to do this. So one of the first things is it's just going to check from the data extraction, did it find a purchase order on the invoice? If yes, then it's gonna go down this path. And then the first thing it's going to do is do a webhook or just do an API call to say, alright. Use the purchase use that purchase order number, to search ProcureSoft and find that and give us data back. So in this case, we tested it, and we were able to get a purchase order number and all the purchase order details here. Which is which is really valuable. And then, ultimately, what it James do then is finally create a draft invoice directly in ProcureSoft the data we extracted linked to a purchase order. And so I skipped over a lot of stuff here, but that's that's really where we're after. And I think when I I've never used ProcureSoft before. I've been reading a the documentation, but a draft invoice like that with all the information filled in, assuming it was accurate, would that be like, that's ideal for you, Lisa? Or or Yeah. We're having an issue. Draft invoices are a little odd in ProcureSoft. We we're having issues where going to match a PO an invoice to a PO, and then we're like, okay. This isn't even for the right entity or the right PO. We can't delete that draft. It stays in draft. So I have to manually go in and void it. So we our drafts is kind of a nightmare right now. I'm I'm trying to keep them clean. But, again, my team doesn't have access to certain things, so it's just it's it's very painful. So maybe I don't know if we have to change maybe the status to, like, new instead of draft. I don't know if that's something that we can do. We can. Yeah. I think it's a question, Lisa, of, like, what would be easiest for your team? Like, what's the queue design that's gonna FlowBuilder it easiest for you guys to review without it actually, like, being fully approved right off the bat because we still want some control. Yep. So is that, like, a different status, or is that a different part of the ProcureSoft portal altogether? Like, what would you like? Yeah. Yeah. That would be nice if we we were able to to figure out, like, what that status would be. But new might be the the way to go. Okay. Yep. New status. Yeah. And then, I'm curious. Can you what I don't know if it'd be worth showing ProcureSoft Right? Yeah. I can pull it up. Yeah. That would be cool. Just to see, and I'll stop sharing my screen just to see what that queue might look like. And and then also with the I just wanna do that. With the purchase orders, are there are you typically matching for I know about my depth here, but purchase order lines are like, a lot of different lines on the purchase order themselves and the invoice might match to multiple purchase order lines. Is that right? Correct. Correct. Exactly. Yep. Yeah. And it might be service versus items. So exactly. Yep. And let's say a new invoice gets created and we're able to attempt to try to match to the right purchase order lines too. If it is in this new status, is tweaking that matching after the fact is that a big deal, or is that, like, I'm try I guess I'm trying to say, like, if we if we is it more of a burden to try to match Assuming we have some high degree of confidence, we can do it. Or would it be better just to leave those unmatched unless we're a 100%? You should leave it unmatched because it can yeah, it can get a little funky if you start matching things. And if it's already a duplicate, we have issues with duplicate invoices where they're coming over CXML, but then we get the invoice again. And email. You know what I mean? So there's a little there's a bunch of, like, the different nuances. So, Sarah, the screen that you're in, if you go to views, on the left hand side next to all, you should be able to see the draft new status. We can split this out as well and FlowBuilder a different queue for new. But you can see there's a lot if you scroll through, like, there's a lot of garbage in here. So my team's been working on trying to put notes in here for waiting for things to be approved. Different things like that. But a lot of it's, like, zero, and they just can't void it out. It just it saves a dummy in there, and then you just I see. I tried cleaning this at one point, but it's literally every time they just go in to create an invoice and then they back out, it literally just saves a draft. It's reversed. It's the worst. So it's actually like, it would it be better to create a custom view that says, like, invoice queue, you know, like, automated invoice queue or something. Is it better that you can We could do that. Yeah. It's just the I don't know what's status you'd need to use for that. You know what I mean? Like I see. I see. All the statuses are preprogrammed. Yeah.  \nMe: Potentially dumb question.  \nThem: Okay.  \nMe: Could we on that last page that we were just  \nThem: Back.  \nMe: on.  \nThem: Mhmm.  \nMe: I had a thought of how to not have them go and I'm drawing oh, could we could would it be reasonable to FlowBuilder just once a day run run an automation that just clears all the drafts, or are some of them actually useful?  \nThem: Some of them are useful. So my team yeah. So I tell my team, like, reuse them. Like right? So if you're backing it out, like, you can go back in, edit it, and just reuse it for another invoice. Like, just don't leave it there. Like, I know I have one in there right now that's completely CRO, and it says chart of accounts, none. Like so, clearly, I didn't even go in to void that one. But  \nMe: Okay. That  \nThem: when we were learning the system, no one really told us about this cue or told us that like, every time you click in one and you back out, it saves it. Like, we should have a delete button in reality to get rid of it. But I don't know if that's a ProcureSoft thing, but it's it it's been painful. To say the least, to try to figure out how to manage these. But to your point, Alex, that does FlowBuilder sense that if you do have a draft, that it would automatically just get rid of it. Yeah. And I like that idea. So I'm gonna write that down. I mean, is that, like, Lisa, so the right way to tell would be is, like, anything that says none, basically, stuff that you don't want in there, or are some of these that have information in there ones that you would get rid of as well? I would think the ones that say none, we can probably dump out. The ones that have invoice numbers, I'd have to check with each member of the team and just say, hey. Are these are these real, or is this a duplicatable already entered, and this one just didn't get backed out? It it just randomly how it gets saved in the system. But I would say the ones  \nMe: This might be  \nThem: that have none, you can probably get rid of if there's zero.  \nMe: overkill, and and let me know if this is just, like, too much for this, but we might do something similar like we were doing with the licenses where it's like, hey. We're gonna delete this unless you  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: bond. To us type thing. Like, we'll delete the ones that are none if there's an invoice number like, hey, this is a list of things that's gonna get deleted today.  \nThem: Right.  \nMe: Let us know if we need to save any of these type thing. That much just might be too I wanna I realized that's a little off what we were talking about originally.  \nThem: Yeah. No. Because, I mean, I think that does like, depends. Because, Lisa, it's probably like I mean, you guys sit in the same area. You're, like, talking to your team day in and day out. So Yep. It's probably not that hard to say, you know, just hey. Is do we need to get rid of this one, or is it a you know, should we keep it in there? But I I think the like, removing the not the ones with none are very clearly, you know, some just work that we're saving where we're like, yep. We should get rid of that. Yeah. Don't know. What do you think? Yeah. I agree. I I just I think, like, we can probably do a data and that's a moment in time too. Like, this list changes like, minutes minute. Right? My team is in here all day. So could always just on one and kinda, like, run through, and I can talk to my team and say, okay, guys. Like, if you're actually saving one that's in draft, then there needs to be a supplier note On the right hand side, there's a column that says supplier note. Like, those say none. But if if you scroll down, there should be some that have notes in there. Because I know that they're working with users and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There are some yeah. But I don't know. It's just a matter of trying yeah. See, all those that say none can probably go It's just I wish ProcureSoft was cleaner. Like, it's just Yeah. It's not clean at all. Because I know Kevin would like to use this cue to kinda see, like,  \nMe: Should this.  \nThem: what's pending out there, like, waiting for answers from individuals and things like that. But it's such a messy queue. It it he can't even use it right now.  \nMe: That FlowBuilder sense?  \nThem: So that's something yeah. Sarah, we can talk about this offline, though, if you want. About Yeah. I mean, I think if if that's, like, another thing, it would be a time saver for your team. We should absolutely see if we can create that. That great. Yeah. We can do that. Yep. Alex's That'd be awesome. I do something that like that with my tasks. Where I just say, hey. If I haven't edited or updated this task in the last thirty days, automatically archive it. Right? So my task looks it's like, I'm never gonna get to that get it out And I'm I'm hoping and one thing I just looked at now is you can get all the draft invoices from ProcureSoft, and then you I I would have to check to see, like, what was the created we can do about created a two or last modified to say, that it's been more than thirty days. It's probably not even something worth thinking about. Mhmm. Mhmm. Clean it out.  \nMe: Maybe two technical questions. Jordan, do we need to update the the risk what is it called? The permissions of the key if we're if we're gonna be trying to delete some of these. Like, because I think we, like, didn't  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: delete permission. Right?  \nThem: We might just go. Yeah. We might need to, but we don't.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted it's just like a  \nThem: Yeah. Look at that.  \nMe: side thought I had.  \nThem: Yep. For sure. Okay. Cool. Well, that that that could be good. Could be a good outcome of this too is where AutomateFlow has a great schedule. It says get all the old draft get draft invoices. Yeah. We could configure it however. The the flexibility is endless and, like, what what is helpful, Lisa, as as we go through this is just saying, like, what would be ideal for your team And even if we can't do that a 100%, like, maybe we can do 95%. Yeah. Yeah. And so that is, like, super useful to know, and we can continue to just iterate around it and FlowBuilder it and dial it in, FlowBuilder it better and better. Yep. My question at this point, Jordan, is, like, you know, it's been awesome to have your help with, like, building this out. In terms of testing and making sure that it's working well, would love your advice. So on the sort of, like, data ingestion, is it work is it picking up off of invoices from the inbox, and is it taking the right information? I feel pretty good about testing that. I can take the files that Lisa gave, and I can, you know, send myself a bunch of, like, non invoice attachments as well and just see if it's picking up on that. And look at the table and kind of see, like, how many just kinda give it a quality check. Right? How many of the fields is it picking up on, and is it making any errors? In terms of testing what the queue looks like in ProcureSoft, I'm trying to think about the best way to do that without messing up like, Lisa, your team's workflow because, like, there is gonna be random stuff in there that's clearly not relevant because we're just testing this in a historical way. So We test it in the sandbox environment ProcureSoft, or do we have to do it in production? Oh, yeah. It the okay. Gotcha. Yeah. Maybe I can talk to David about what that access to that sandbox looks like. Do you on your end, have you used the sandbox before? Yep. Okay. Cool. I've used it. Yep. And I believe they're refreshing it. So to the current status of our production instance. So I think it FlowBuilder more sense to probably test it in there. Yeah. Is that does that have copy some, like, sandbox copies sometimes have, like, partial data. So we're like, would it have also purchase orders and stuff that we could try to match against? Sure. It should. Yep. Great. That would be awesome. Because then we can I mean, not go wild, but then we cannot worry about Yeah? Yeah. I prefer you do that only because, again, there's 50 some companies in here. If you start putting data in, it's gonna be very difficult for me to try to weed it out. Yeah. So We prefer that too. Yeah. Yep. Okay. And based on the setup that we have so far, Jordan, it's not it hasn't put anything in here yet. Right? It's just putting it into the table. The only real API call we did was to get to try to find a matching purchase order, which was just reading data. That was it. Gotcha. Yeah. I mean, that's the other part. Like, Lisa, to your point, if if the PO matching is wrong, it's probably more work to it and then try to find the right one. But we can see mean, I think it's at least worth testing, like, is it good at that? Because if we're getting really high accuracy, it could be you know, an additional time saver. But I like that the, you know, the fallback of not having it match is still a good outcome if we It is. It's Yeah. Because to your point, Sarah, like, having it at because all the invoice information James already be on there. Right? Because we can remove the PO line from the invoice and then just pick from another PO. See what else is in there. Do you know what I'm saying? So it's Mhmm. It's gonna be easier because then we're not entering it from scratch. Like, you know, it's already there. Yep. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. We again, we have flexibility to say we could create the invoice with just the header information and no line items. Right. Or we create the invoice and the line items and try not to match POs. One opportunity that might be good too later on as we get more into this to say, like, here's all the repetitive invoices that come in every month. Like, first one you mentioned. And, like, it's pretty vanilla. Always gonna be to this one purchase order. It's a blanket PO. You know? It has one line. It's easy to match to. Those, we could potentially automate end to end. Right? Say, here's a supplier list. And really give that tight control and take that entire process off your plate. Before trying to handle all the potential other gotchas and more complicated ones. Yeah. And so James they work the same for, like, non p o ones, Jordan? So, like, Thermo Fisher Financial, that example I used before, is a non PO. It goes to the same account, same GL, every single time across the board. So it's like, if we could just have it remember, like, this invoice, when it comes in, know, for this specific thing, it just automatically just goes to this account. Every time. You know what I mean? And then that would be, like, to me, Sarah, that's, like, a big win. Right? Soup to nuts. It's like, they just pull through the system, post through the same Like, if we could give it a training data file, if we already know what those repetitive ones are, like, Jordan, could we just we could just feed the LLM the list of, like, this particular recurring invoice should go to this account whenever you see it come in. And Yeah. We can do it any whatever the most easiest whatever the simplest way. Like, how would you tell a human to go in match that? Right? If we we could test save that data in a table, does AutomateFlow table say, this supplier name or even this supplier ID comes in for this invoice and it matches that, then it should go through and maybe check one or two other things, but it's likely a repetitive invoice. Posted to ProcureSoft into the pending, you know, review queue directly. Yep. So what whatever you yeah. Whatever that process looks like to say, how do you figure out or know, know, how would you tell a 15 year old to go and match this in ProcureSoft? Right? That's what that kind of information is how we could we could build it out for sure.  \nMe: Okay.  \nThem: Yeah. No. And actually seeing it live now, makes me like, I it it was hard for me to imagine how this was gonna going from an email. And then how would it look on the email side, Jordan? Like right? So once puts it into ProcureSoft, what happens to that email in Outlook? Does it get flagged? What does it do to that? We can do whatever makes sense. We could I think we have the email, so I we could reply to it. We could flag yeah. Yeah. We could add it to a folder. Okay. Okay. Whatever whatever works best is kinda yeah, what yeah. Whatever works best would be the way to go. Oh, wow. Okay. No. That's Push it into existence, Lisa. You don't even know. There's a lot of mailboxes here. So we have a process folder for every single mailbox, like, that in Outlook. So for me, it's like just having it moved somewhere else to have the history on it in case we needed to look at it again. But yeah, I know. That that's great. Like so visually seeing it to me, like, makes me feel better and, like, understanding it a little bit more. So Yeah. How does it and I don't maybe you weren't part of the initial conversations. I can't remember. How is this looking and feeling compared to that I haven't looked at all at Rossum, so I'm not sure what what it's what it looks like. That wasn't a software we ever looked at, so I have no idea what they're gonna be showing us. But if this seems to be so much and a bit simpler for me I know in the background, it's it's a lot more building and, you know, putting things together, and then there's a lot again, there's a lot of outlook and I know you have to set things a certain way for each one to be. Yeah. I'd be interested to see what what Rossum is gonna what it looks like. But this seems to be a better way, I think, for it to do it only because you have more control in the back end. And maximized ability. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, so I know we're meeting with Flossom in a couple of weeks, I think. So Yeah. We'll see how that goes. But, no, this looks promising. And, Alex, you want big points with me today about this whole bot thing to address.  \nMe: I'm glad. I'm glad. But that's what I'm here for. To say to say one or two sentences and  \nThem: You don't know. I fix a lot of integration, and I'm I literally, like, don't have a systems background, but I I love technology. So I'm like, I'm always, like, fixing integration errors in the background, just trying to understand how the systems talk. So I'm I'm, like, a a nerd when it comes to that. So yeah. No. That makes my life easier if we can get that moving to Sarah.  \nMe: And Sarah, what let me know if this is something that I shouldn't offer, but we are doing, like, the a workshop with the executive team in a couple weeks. Would it FlowBuilder sense for Lisa to join that conversation? Sarah, I would refer to you on on that.  \nThem: Yeah. I mean, I so we're they're coming to our IT leadership team meeting, Lisa. If it's helpful, we could do, like, a session with finance. I if if there you know, you and Kevin or anybody else on the team that wants to learn how to like, build stuff like this. I mean, what Jordan built out is very complex. But the, you know, the benefit of the platform and the other piece that we're evaluating is can we teach people how to do, like, further every day? You know, I have meetings coming up. Like, give me a summary of what meetings are upcoming or, you know, how to prep or, you know, whatever you wanna integrate it with and build. So that, you know, that could certainly be an option if you think there would be interest. But Yeah. I I'd be interested to going. Again, like, I'm I'm I'm a super nerd when it comes to, like, systems and learning. Like, I have all the up uppity up stuff on my phone, like AI, and people are like, oh my god. You can do that. I'm like, oh my god. I love technology. So I'm more yeah. If you wanna add me to that, would be great. And I would say add Kevin too. I'm I'm assuming Kevin would like it as well. And then I don't know if anybody from, like, the finance side would wanna join. But again but, like, seeing it live, Sarah, it's it's, like, completely eye opening to me and just, like, being able to understand, like, what it can do.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: What I mean? I couldn't wrap my head around. Like, how is it gonna move it from, like, an Outlook to ProcureSoft? Like, how would it talk? But, like Yeah. But watching it, it's just yeah. It it's super cool to see. So Yeah. That's awesome. And thanks for your time, and I so what I'll do is I'll do a bunch of, like, testing. I think once we have some test results and tweaking, I would love to, you know, bring Kevin in too and show him in, like, hopefully, we can do it in the sandbox environment so that you can also get a feel for, like, what James the end user experience look like. Yep. So that'll be really great.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Yeah. So, yeah, just get the access to that. That would be good.  \nMe: Yep. Sorry.  \nThem: I think doing it in there.  \nMe: Tactical question, and maybe this James what what does it take to get access to the sandbox environment? Like, is that is that something  \nThem: I'll talk to David. I think it would be David and our infrastructure team that would  \nMe: Okay. Oh.  \nThem: be able to help us out there. Yeah. So  \nMe: Sounds good?  \nThem: I'll do that.  \nMe: Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it. \n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/...

But, yeah, I I James everyone here knows me, so maybe, like, Jordan, Alex, Lisa, I'll let you guys do intros to each other. Sure. Yeah. Lisa, why don't you kick us off? I'm happy to happy to do that. So I've been with Horizon Ventures for almost eight years. I oversee all the accounts payable for all the Lab companies and Pioneering Medicines. I had purchasing at one time as well. And I finally handed that off last year. So I'm a little happy about that. But but we just started using ProcureSoft, so I'm hoping to try to streamline the process a little bit for my team because we process a lot of volume here. For all these companies. So there's, I think, 52 or 54 companies in our portfolio right now that we do payables for. So it's it's a very busy Mhmm. Yeah. I can really imagine. Well, that's great. It's good to meet you. I'm I'm the solution taker here. At AutomateFlow, so I get to help a lot of customers with, you know, designing and building Zaps in different workflows. To, you know, automate their process as much as possible. So I I love doing it. Love building. And excited to kinda talk to you today and show you what we have. Okay."

Cool. Well, no worries at all. I James let me share my screen. I'm I'm ready this time. Whereas last time, I couldn't use it with Microsoft Teams, but so, Lisa, what we have, I think, Sarah took some notes last time you guys talked and passed these along here. A lot going on with ProcureSoft, and you mentioned ProcureSoft's relatively is newish. How long have you guys been using long have you been using ProcureSoft? So we we did it in three waves. And the final wave went live September. So we're about, like, four months in with all the lab companies. Pioneering Medicines. I I think we've we've gotten a good grasp on it at this point, but there there are like, little weird nuances here and there. But just trying to go through the new flow in in the system. So it's been about four months, so I'm assuming. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah. That that's all the context. And so what we heard a lot of the big pain points around, just to recap, You'll know them well. It's manually having to input invoices, know, looking at the PDF in another window, manually inputting that. And then understanding and trying to match it to an existing purchase order or find the right purchase order. And line up and getting all that done. I think there's some other things around with repetitive invoices processing. And trying to do a lot with managing exceptions in in different policies. When yeah. And a number of things come in with the invoices for for this. So I'm curious just before I show what we have and we'll dive into some questions. What what do you feel like is your top of mind for your biggest wish list item or, like, or maybe even if it's easier, what's your biggest pain point today? With ProcureSoft or or for your team? It's not so much, like, processing wise. I mean, my team kind of adapts pretty quickly. Like, we have some veterans on my team, so we we kind of adapt to changes very quickly. It's it's mostly just vendor issues that we we've been having a a lot with. I and I hope fully the system can FlowBuilder things a little bit better. But it it's just the volume is is kind of, like, just trying to with it. Yep. Yeah. That makes sense. And the volume being, like, like, just the amount of invoices to input and to tie out to purchase orders, that kinda So so I'm I'm gonna give you, like, an example. So, like, a lot of repetitive invoices. So, like, Thermo Fisher Financial, we probably get about a 100 to a 150 invoices a month, and it's, like, individual invoices, same contract amounts, every single month, and we literally have to copy a previous invoice, enter it. And you know what I mean? Like, we can eliminate having to do that at all, like, that to me would be, like, huge. Right? So it'd save much more time. So Awesome. Well, great great use case. Great example. Thanks for that. Enough enough questions. So this is this is AutomateFlow. We're where we are right now, and I'm kinda zooming it out, but this is just like a whiteboarding tool, essentially. That we have internally at AutomateFlow. And AutomateFlow is made up of things called Zaps, which are, you know, you can imagine that everything has a trigger. You know, when this happens, do this. Right? And you have actions along the way that are are executing and we also have filtering within an automation. So it's very hopefully, user friendly to build out an automation. We have tables as well to you think of this just like an Excel, Google Sheet, or just a normal table. And, we have some agents tripped in as well. So that's just some context, but one of the things that we have working today are already so today that we have and I walk through this example here where we have right now, it's it's monitoring off of we had it linked up to Sarah's inbox. So it is saying, you know, when a new we have a trigger that's set up to say when a new email comes in with an attached it James start it'll kick off this automation. So it goes through and it says, you know, check. Is this a is the attachment a PDF? Sarah, this was something I added yesterday just after seeing all the errors come through. And maybe I'll show what first question for you, Lisa. Is it always coming in with PDF attachments, or are they sometimes, like, in the body of the email or some weird format? It come yeah. It come usually, top is always PDF. Secondary, it might be a Word doc. And then thirdly, it might be in the body of the email. So Okay. But in reality, it should always be a PDF. Yep. Cool. Yeah. Great question. Sweet. Yeah. So those emails come in. We'll do a check, and we can update this to accommodate all three two different file types, and then looking at the body too. That can be another look at that. But it comes in, looks at the PDF, and then we have, AI by AutomateFlow step built into this, and it's just using OpenAI. And it is able to extract the data from the file, It would do the same thing if it's a Word doc or if it's in a body. Then it gives us an output of fields so that we can then use down the line. So in this case, it's checking, hey. Is this a actual invoice? Because maybe these I imagine your AP inboxes get other emails with potentially attachments that aren't invoices. Is that right? Yep. Yep. Yeah. In this case, it's looking and reading the and here was one that I think Sarah ran through, and it said you know, this was an email that came in. And this was just a yeah. One of the meetings, and then it filtered it out and said stop because it was not the right thing. Here's the AI by AutomateFlow. So is this an invoice? False. And so we just stopped this automation and doesn't continue. So then from here, it extracts the invoice data. Which, if I come back in we can show here's some examples here. We've we've had this tested on a few different invoices just to see, like, how reliable is it. This is something we'll took, like, Lisa, the, I think you uploaded twenty. I made them like, I had AI do dummy data. So, like, take out any sensitive info, but just, like, replace all the numbers and stuff. And we have been using them to kinda test this functionality, so that's Jordan's referring to here. Okay. Yep. So then the example here of that would be this table, which, like, so here is the synthetic, you know, 19. This is one of the ones that just kinda dummy data. And we can start to see we have a structured output from this PDF. Of here's the invoice numbers, the supplier name, invoice date, payment due date. When don't know if there's any payment terms or currency specified. So we can start to really extract data automatically from this, and this James be we can just monitor and dial in over time. To see, you know, did this work? If not, you know, where where is it falling short? How reliable is it? But what we've seen with our first initial very admittedly small subset, with five. It is very good at this, and extracting data and putting it into structured fields. So so that continues the process. It it looks at the invoice header data, and then, critically, it gets it also does the same thing with the line items. So in this case, we're doing what's called a loop inside AutomateFlow, which just saying, you know, if it's got two line items or if it's got 10, it James do run this over and over for however many line items it has. And then upload that again to a table to save that extracted data. So I know you guys I think you mentioned you're using an OCR today. Have there been any issues or or no? Not yet? Mhmm. Yeah. Evaluating. As part of this pilot Cool. And has there been I I mean, I guess beyond just is it does it work reliably? Is there any kind of, like, wish list on the OCR or is it just looking at these AP invoices? I believe so. Yes. K. Or that would be what it would be used for. Yep. Yep. Invoices, credit memos, would probably be the main two. We OCR and our in our previous system before we went to ProcureSoft, and, it was literally reading just invoice data, like invoice header information, total invoice, all that stuff. But that was all it was doing. Okay. Yeah. And this would be something too, like, if you wanted to do a bigger test, just for to carve out that OCR separately. Like, this the nice thing about this, and I think we Sarah's seen this where you can it's as flexible as you want with just natural language. So coming here with this app, and just said, like, hey. Look for you know, the number of I don't know, a line item, decimal amount. I could sense. You could put that in here, it would start to look for that. And then put that in Additionally, I'll put that in structured data. So it's really flexible as well. Okay. So the Where does the data go after it goes through this search? Are you getting to that? I'm sorry. I'm just trying to Like Yep. Exactly right. So, yeah, this is the first part of the system where says we got a new invoice from the inbox. Now it's going to save it inside a AutomateFlow table. And then this would be, you know, where we want to go and say, let's switch to this switch to this view. And so now what we can do is, like, look at all these you know, take this invoice, for example. We have the PDF. Side by side in the table, and we also have all the files the fields that's extracted so that if you wanted to review it, you know, especially as we start testing this more, it would be let us review it before we say, hey. Kick off the final Zap or the second Zap, which is actually going to try to create an invoice inside ProcureSoft. A matching But I think the so this table, to to me, is more of, like, what we use as we're building this out to test it. And, Lisa, like, once we have this up and running, you know, live, it could be something where, like, we audit it once in a while we can figure out, like, what that looks like from the IT perspective. Just to FlowBuilder sure that it's doing those things properly. But from, like, an end user standpoint for you and your team, we're building this out so that it creates the queue directly in ProcureSoft. So you guys won't have to look at a separate data source. It'll just go in there. Yep. Perfect. Yeah. That's awesome. Right. So then, you know, while we're doing the pilot, so this is really the the bread and butter of this you know, of this automation where now we can really start to and we'll continue to build out this Zap over time. But what it'll do now is, know, I think as Sarah mentioned, it's we're getting triggered from that table, but ultimately, long term, it'll just run automatically as we extract the data. It'll start to do this. So one of the first things is it's just going to check from the data extraction, did it find a purchase order on the invoice? If yes, then it's gonna go down this path. And then the first thing it's going to do is do a webhook or just do an API call to say, alright. Use the purchase use that purchase order number, to search ProcureSoft and find that and give us data back. So in this case, we tested it, and we were able to get a purchase order number and all the purchase order details here. Which is which is really valuable. And then, ultimately, what it James do then is finally create a draft invoice directly in ProcureSoft the data we extracted linked to a purchase order. And so I skipped over a lot of stuff here, but that's that's really where we're after. And I think when I I've never used ProcureSoft before. I've been reading a the documentation, but a draft invoice like that with all the information filled in, assuming it was accurate, would that be like, that's ideal for you, Lisa? Or or Yeah. We're having an issue. Draft invoices are a little odd in ProcureSoft. We we're having issues where going to match a PO an invoice to a PO, and then we're like, okay. This isn't even for the right entity or the right PO. We can't delete that draft. It stays in draft. So I have to manually go in and void it. So we our drafts is kind of a nightmare right now. I'm I'm trying to keep them clean. But, again, my team doesn't have access to certain things, so it's just it's it's very painful. So maybe I don't know if we have to change maybe the status to, like, new instead of draft. I don't know if that's something that we can do. We can. Yeah. I think it's a question, Lisa, of, like, what would be easiest for your team? Like, what's the queue design that's gonna FlowBuilder it easiest for you guys to review without it actually, like, being fully approved right off the bat because we still want some control. Yep. So is that, like, a different status, or is that a different part of the ProcureSoft portal altogether? Like, what would you like? Yeah. Yeah. That would be nice if we we were able to to figure out, like, what that status would be. But new might be the the way to go. Okay. Yep. New status. Yeah. And then, I'm curious. Can you what I don't know if it'd be worth showing ProcureSoft Right? Yeah. I can pull it up. Yeah. That would be cool. Just to see, and I'll stop sharing my screen just to see what that queue might look like. And and then also with the I just wanna do that. With the purchase orders, are there are you typically matching for I know about my depth here, but purchase order lines are like, a lot of different lines on the purchase order themselves and the invoice might match to multiple purchase order lines. Is that right? Correct. Correct. Exactly. Yep. Yeah. And it might be service versus items. So exactly. Yep. And let's say a new invoice gets created and we're able to attempt to try to match to the right purchase order lines too. If it is in this new status, is tweaking that matching after the fact is that a big deal, or is that, like, I'm try I guess I'm trying to say, like, if we if we is it more of a burden to try to match Assuming we have some high degree of confidence, we can do it. Or would it be better just to leave those unmatched unless we're a 100%? You should leave it unmatched because it can yeah, it can get a little funky if you start matching things. And if it's already a duplicate, we have issues with duplicate invoices where they're coming over CXML, but then we get the invoice again. And email. You know what I mean? So there's a little there's a bunch of, like, the different nuances. So, Sarah, the screen that you're in, if you go to views, on the left hand side next to all, you should be able to see the draft new status. We can split this out as well and FlowBuilder a different queue for new. But you can see there's a lot if you scroll through, like, there's a lot of garbage in here. So my team's been working on trying to put notes in here for waiting for things to be approved. Different things like that. But a lot of it's, like, zero, and they just can't void it out. It just it saves a dummy in there, and then you just I see. I tried cleaning this at one point, but it's literally every time they just go in to create an invoice and then they back out, it literally just saves a draft. It's reversed. It's the worst. So it's actually like, it would it be better to create a custom view that says, like, invoice queue, you know, like, automated invoice queue or something. Is it better that you can We could do that. Yeah. It's just the I don't know what's status you'd need to use for that. You know what I mean? Like I see. I see. All the statuses are preprogrammed. Yeah."

To say the least, to try to figure out how to manage these. But to your point, Alex, that does FlowBuilder sense that if you do have a draft, that it would automatically just get rid of it. Yeah. And I like that idea. So I'm gonna write that down. I mean, is that, like, Lisa, so the right way to tell would be is, like, anything that says none, basically, stuff that you don't want in there, or are some of these that have information in there ones that you would get rid of as well? I would think the ones that say none, we can probably dump out. The ones that have invoice numbers, I'd have to check with each member of the team and just say, hey. Are these are these real, or is this a duplicatable already entered, and this one just didn't get backed out? It it just randomly how it gets saved in the system. But I would say the ones"

Is do we need to get rid of this one, or is it a you know, should we keep it in there? But I I think the like, removing the not the ones with none are very clearly, you know, some just work that we're saving where we're like, yep. We should get rid of that. Yeah. Don't know. What do you think? Yeah. I agree. I I just I think, like, we can probably do a data and that's a moment in time too. Like, this list changes like, minutes minute. Right? My team is in here all day. So could always just on one and kinda, like, run through, and I can talk to my team and say, okay, guys. Like, if you're actually saving one that's in draft, then there needs to be a supplier note On the right hand side, there's a column that says supplier note. Like, those say none. But if if you scroll down, there should be some that have notes in there. Because I know that they're working with users and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There are some yeah. But I don't know. It's just a matter of trying yeah. See, all those that say none can probably go It's just I wish ProcureSoft was cleaner. Like, it's just Yeah. It's not clean at all.

So my task looks it's like, I'm never gonna get to that get it out And I'm I'm hoping and one thing I just looked at now is you can get all the draft invoices from ProcureSoft, and then you I I would have to check to see, like, what was the created we can do about created a two or last modified to say, that it's been more than thirty days.

          "text": "Yep. For sure. Okay. Cool. Well, that that that could be good. Could be a good outcome of this too is where AutomateFlow has a great schedule. It says get all the old draft get draft invoices. Yeah. We could configure it however. The the flexibility is endless and, like, what what is helpful, Lisa, as as we go through this is just saying, like, what would be ideal for your team And even if we can't do that a 100%, like, maybe we can do 95%. Yeah. Yeah. And so that is, like, super useful to know, and we can continue to just iterate around it and FlowBuilder it and dial it in, FlowBuilder it better and better. Yep. My question at this point, Jordan, is, like, you know, it's been awesome to have your help with, like, building this out. In terms of testing and making sure that it's working well, would love your advice. So on the sort of, like, data ingestion, is it work is it picking up off of invoices from the inbox, and is it taking the right information? I feel pretty good about testing that. I can take the files that Lisa gave, and I can, you know, send myself a bunch of, like, non invoice attachments as well and just see if it's picking up on that. And look at the table and kind of see, like, how many just kinda give it a quality check. Right? How many of the fields is it picking up on, and is it making any errors? In terms of testing what the queue looks like in ProcureSoft, I'm trying to think about the best way to do that without messing up like, Lisa, your team's workflow because, like, there is gonna be random stuff in there that's clearly not relevant because we're just testing this in a historical way. So We test it in the sandbox environment ProcureSoft, or do we have to do it in production? Oh, yeah. It the okay. Gotcha. Yeah. Maybe I can talk to David about what that access to that sandbox looks like. Do you on your end, have you used the sandbox before? Yep. Okay. Cool. I've used it. Yep. And I believe they're refreshing it. So to the current status of our production instance. So I think it FlowBuilder more sense to probably test it in there. Yeah. Is that does that have copy some, like, sandbox copies sometimes have, like, partial data. So we're like, would it have also purchase orders and stuff that we could try to match against? Sure. It should. Yep. Great. That would be awesome. Because then we can I mean, not go wild, but then we cannot worry about Yeah? Yeah. I prefer you do that only because, again, there's 50 some companies in here. If you start putting data in, it's gonna be very difficult for me to try to weed it out. Yeah. So We prefer that too. Yeah. Yep. Okay. And based on the setup that we have so far, Jordan, it's not it hasn't put anything in here yet. Right? It's just putting it into the table. The only real API call we did was to get to try to find a matching purchase order, which was just reading data. That was it. Gotcha. Yeah. I mean, that's the other part. Like, Lisa, to your point, if if the PO matching is wrong, it's probably more work to it and then try to find the right one. But we can see mean, I think it's at least worth testing, like, is it good at that? Because if we're getting really high accuracy, it could be you know, an additional time saver. But I like that the, you know, the fallback of not having it match is still a good outcome if we It is. It's Yeah. Because to your point, Sarah, like, having it at because all the invoice information James already be on there. Right? Because we can remove the PO line from the invoice and then just pick from another PO. See what else is in there. Do you know what I'm saying? So it's Mhmm. It's gonna be easier because then we're not entering it from scratch. Like, you know, it's already there. Yep. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. We again, we have flexibility to say we could create the invoice with just the header information and no line items. Right. Or we create the invoice and the line items and try not to match POs. One opportunity that might be good too later on as we get more into this to say, like, here's all the repetitive invoices that come in every month. Like, first one you mentioned. And, like, it's pretty vanilla. Always gonna be to this one purchase order. It's a blanket PO. You know? It has one line. It's easy to match to. Those, we could potentially automate end to end. Right? Say, here's a supplier list. And really give that tight control and take that entire process off your plate. Before trying to handle all the potential other gotchas and more complicated ones. Yeah. And so James they work the same for, like, non p o ones, Jordan? So, like, Thermo Fisher Financial, that example I used before, is a non PO. It goes to the same account, same GL, every single time across the board. So it's like, if we could just have it remember, like, this invoice, when it comes in, know, for this specific thing, it just automatically just goes to this account. Every time. You know what I mean? And then that would be, like, to me, Sarah, that's, like, a big win. Right? Soup to nuts. It's like, they just pull through the system, post through the same Like, if we could give it a training data file, if we already know what those repetitive ones are, like, Jordan, could we just we could just feed the LLM the list of, like, this particular recurring invoice should go to this account whenever you see it come in. And Yeah. We can do it any whatever the most easiest whatever the simplest way. Like, how would you tell a human to go in match that? Right? If we we could test save that data in a table, does AutomateFlow table say, this supplier name or even this supplier ID comes in for this invoice and it matches that, then it should go through and maybe check one or two other things, but it's likely a repetitive invoice. Posted to ProcureSoft into the pending, you know, review queue directly. Yep. So what whatever you yeah. Whatever that process looks like to say, how do you figure out or know, know, how would you tell a 15 year old to go and match this in ProcureSoft? Right? That's what that kind of information is how we could we could build it out for sure."

We can do whatever makes sense. We could I think we have the email, so I we could reply to it. We could flag yeah. Yeah. We could add it to a folder. Okay. Okay. Whatever whatever works best is kinda yeah, what yeah. Whatever works best would be the way to go. Oh, wow. Okay. No. That's Push it into existence, Lisa. You don't even know. There's a lot of mailboxes here. So we have a process folder for every single mailbox, like, that in Outlook. So for me, it's like just having it moved somewhere else to have the history on it in case we needed to look at it again. But yeah, I know. That that's great. Like so visually seeing it to me, like, makes me feel better and, like, understanding it a little bit more. So Yeah. How does it and I don't maybe you weren't part of the initial conversations. I can't remember. How is this looking and feeling compared to that I haven't looked at all at Rossum, so I'm not sure what what it's what it looks like. That wasn't a software we ever looked at, so I have no idea what they're gonna be showing us. But if this seems to be so much and a bit simpler for me I know in the background, it's it's a lot more building and, you know, putting things together, and then there's a lot again, there's a lot of outlook and I know you have to set things a certain way for each one to be. Yeah. I'd be interested to see what what Rossum is gonna what it looks like. But this seems to be a better way, I think, for it to do it only because you have more control in the back end. And maximized ability. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, so I know we're meeting with Flossom in a couple of weeks, I think. So Yeah. We'll see how that goes. But, no, this looks promising.

But the, you know, the benefit of the platform and the other piece that we're evaluating is can we teach people how to do, like, further every day? You know, I have meetings coming up. Like, give me a summary of what meetings are upcoming or, you know, how to prep or, you know, whatever you wanna integrate it with and build. So that, you know, that could certainly be an option if you think there would be interest. But Yeah. I I'd be interested to going.

(5) Mike met Jordan for first time - has IntegrateHub experience, used AutomateFlow ~2 years ago. **Blockers:** Outlook OAuth still no timeline, ProcureSoft API not yet connected. **Other opportunities:** Sarah experimenting with Brandfolder MCP + facial recognition (Google Vision API), asked about MCP pricing (Jordan to follow up). **Workshop:** Rachel Mabie confirmed for Feb 18.

Lead with the value breakdown, then show the math.\n\n---\n\n## The Investment Breakdown\n\n### 1. Platform License: [$ TBD]\n\n*What this covers:*\n• Enterprise-grade AutomateFlow platform access\n• Unlimited users (citizen development enabled)\n• BYOM capability - connect your own LLM keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock)\n• App governance - control which apps users can connect\n• SSO/SAML integration\n• SOC 2 Type II compliance\n• Priority support SLA\n\n*Comparable to:* This is not a per-seat model. It's a platform investment.\n\n---\n\n### 2. TAM Support (12 hrs/mo): [$ TBD]\n\n*Standard enterprise = 6 hours/month*\n*Your package = 12 hours/month (2x standard)*\n\n*Why we doubled it:*\n• You're early in AI transformation journey\n• Multiple stakeholders to train (not just Sarah)\n• Two complex use cases to build in 90 days\n• Goal is self-sufficiency by EOY - that takes investment\n\n---\n\n### 3. 90-Day Onboarding: [Included]\n\n*This is NOT a line item charge.* Jordan's hands-on build time for your first two use cases is built into the package.\n\n*What you'd pay externally for this:*\n• Solutions architect at $250/hr × 40 hours = $10-20K+\n• You're getting this included\n\n---\n\n### 4. AI Transformation Strategist: [Included]\n\n*What you'd pay externally for this:*\n• Strategic consulting engagement = $20-50K-50,000/year\n• You're getting this included\n\n---\n\n## The Comparison Frame\n\n| What You're Getting | Market Rate | Your Investment |\n|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Enterprise Platform | - | [$ TBD] |\n| 12 hrs/mo TAM (144 hrs/year) | $36K (@$250/hr) | Included |\n| 90-Day Onboarding (40+ hrs) | $10K+ | Included |\n| AI Strategist | $20-50K | Included |\n| TeamChat Channel Support | - | Included |\n\n---\n\n## Robert's Likely Question: \"What's the discount?\"\n\n*Do not volunteer a discount unprompted.*\n\nIf asked, here are your levers (see January incentives doc):\n• Term commitment (2 year vs 1 year)\n• Signature timing (Jan vs Feb)\n• Case study participation\n• Reference customer commitment\n\n---\n\n## David's Likely Question: \"Can we flex hours up/down?\"\n\n*Default answer:* No - hours are committed annually for resource planning.\n\n*If pushed:* \"Let me take that back to our team. If there's a specific scenario you're planning for, help me understand it so I can see what's possible.\"\n\nDon't commit to flexibility you can't deliver.\n\n---\n\n## The ROI Bridge\n\nBefore price discussion, anchor on value:\n\n*License Governance Use Case:*\n• Est. dormant license cost: [$ - need from Sarah]\n• If we recover even 20% = [$ value]\n\n*Invoice Processing Use Case:*\n• Hours saved per month: [X hours - need from Sarah]\n• At $[Y]/hour = [$ value/year]\n\n*Total recoverable value: [$X] vs. Investment of [$Y] = [X]x ROI*\n\nIf you don't have these numbers, ask Sarah before the Friday call.\n\n---\n\n## Handling \"It's Too Expensive\"\n\n*Don't defend the price. Reframe the comparison.*\n\n\"What are you comparing it to?\"\n• If IntegrateHub: \"You're already paying for IntegrateHub. This is additive capability for agentic AI - different use case.\"\n• If internal build: \"What would it cost to hire a fractional automation engineer? $150-200K fully loaded. This is 1/4 of that.\"\n• If competitor: \"What's included in their support model? Are they building the first use cases with you?\"\n\n---\n\n## What You Need Before Friday\n\n- [ ] Confirm the actual quote numbers to fill in [$TBD] fields\n- [ ] Get license cost estimates from Sarah for ROI calculation\n- [ ] Decide with KR what discount levers you have authority to use\n- [ ] Confirm whether hour flexibility is possible (ask delivery team)\n",

I know there's a lot on your plate evaluating options, and we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to show what a partnership could look like.\n\n*What we heard*\n\nBased on today's conversation, these are the things that matter most as you FlowBuilder this decision:\n\n• *Bring your own model* - Your team needs control over which LLMs touch your data and how. This is non-negotiable from a security and governance standpoint.\n• *Ease of use* - If this is going to scale beyond Sarah, people who aren't technical need to be able to build and maintain workflows without constant hand-holding.\n• *Services and support model* - You want clarity on what's included, what happens when you need to build use case #4, and how we help your team become self-sufficient over time.\n• *Coexistence with IntegrateHub* - This needs to complement what's already working, not blow it up.\n\n*For Emma*\n\nI know you weren't able to join today, but Sarah shared your questions in advance. We've documented our responses in the mutual action plan linked below - specifically around data handling, model connectivity, and guardrails. Happy to schedule a separate conversation if you'd like to go deeper on any of those.\n\n*Path forward*\n\nWe understand you want to move deliberately. Our goal isn't to rush you into a decision - it's to give you and your team what you need to feel confident moving forward.\n\nHere's what we're proposing:\n\n| Date | Activity |\n|------|----------|\n| Jan 20 | Sarah presents business case to COO |\n| Jan 24 | Follow-up conversation on pricing and services model (Robert, David, Sarah) |\n| Week of Jan 27 | Legal/procurement review |\n| Jan 30 | Target contract signature and kickoff |\n\n*What I'll bring to Jan 24*\n\n• Detailed breakdown of our services model - what's included, how TAM hours work, what happens as you scale\n• Pricing structure walkthrough so there are no surprises\n• Training and enablement plan - the path to your team being self-sufficient\n\nOne other thought: Robert, you mentioned trying AutomateFlow on your own and finding it challenging. We often run executive workshops - a hands-on hour where you and a few colleagues build something you can actually use. If that would be helpful in building confidence before you commit, happy to set one up.\n\n*Resources*\n\n• Mutual Action Plan (includes Emma's Q&A): https://example.com/...\n• Enterprise Agreement (for legal review): https://example.com/...\n• Trust Center (for IT/security review): https://example.com/...\n\nLet me know if the 24th works for the follow-up, or if there's a better time given your schedule next week.\n\nBest,\nAlex\n",

      "content": "Horizon Ventures Pioneering — Deal Channel Update\n\nJan 23, 2026 | Post-Alignment Call\n\nTL;DR\n\nPivoted from 3-month paid pilot to 2-week enterprise trial. Robert confirmed $80K is in range IF we prove value. Next check-in Thursday Jan 29. Jordan continues building invoice automation with Sarah. Deal is still alive but execution matters now.\n\nStatus\n\nStage: Enterprise Trial (2 weeks) → Decision Jan 29\n\nAmount: $80K (confirmed in range)\n\nClose Target: Q2 — depends on trial outcomes\n\nCompetition: IntegrateHub (incumbent) — they see us for citizen dev, IntegrateHub for orchestration\n\nWhat Happened\n\nRobert (CIO) and Emma (CISO) had 9am conflict, only stayed 30 min\n\nRobert held firm: \"Won't pay before we prove ourselves\" — burned by past software purchases\n\nKR pivoted us from paid pilot negotiation to 2-week enterprise trial with full support\n\nDavid (Dir, Enterprise Apps) was candid: \"IntegrateHub is known, we're giving AutomateFlow a fair shot\" — not just going through motions\n\nBrian (IntegrateHub builder) James join technical sessions for direct comparison\n\n$80K confirmed in range — gated on proving value, not budget objection\n\nKey Risks\n\nProcureSoft integration: Biggest technical question mark. If we can't write/upload to their procurement system, use case doesn't close.\n\nRobert's pattern: May ask for \"more time\" even if trial goes well. Need to define what \"enough\" looks like before Jan 29.\n\nCriteria not validated: Still don't have specific success metrics agreed with Robert. Evaluation criteria rubric wasn't discussed.\n\nNext Steps\n\nKR: Sending update to Horizon Ventures on plan for next few weeks\n\nAlex: Start security/legal paperwork, follow up with Sarah on logistics\n\nJordan: Continue invoice automation build with Sarah, join finance design session next week\n\nJan 29 check-in: Assess trial progress, decide: extend / paid pilot / full deal\n\nIT Leadership Workshop: TBD timing — Sarah confirming when IT extended LT meets\n\nBottom Line\n\nDeal shifted from pilot negotiation to execution mode. The next two weeks are about proving we can deliver, not talking about whether to pilot. If Jordan and Sarah nail the invoice automation and the IT workshop lands, we're in good shape. If we stumble, inertia wins and IntegrateHub keeps the account.",

We already have approval for 12 TAM hours/month (thanks Linds) - this note is about how I'm positioning the way those hours get used. Want to FlowBuilder sure we're aligned before I go deeper with the customer.\n\nDeal Snapshot\n\nAccount: Horizon Ventures Pioneering (~$80K, targeting Jan 30 close)\n\nChampion: Sarah - driving internally, wants to be self-sufficient by EOY\n\nEconomic buyer: Robert (VP) - engaged, said \"we want to be aggressive, we want to sign\"\n\nUse cases: License governance ($305K savings) and invoice processing ($132K savings)\n\nThe Model I'm Selling\n\nHere's how I'm positioning our support model to Horizon Ventures:\n\nFirst 90 Days (Jordan - SA)\n\nHands-on build of first 2 use cases (license governance + invoice processing)\n\nFull documentation of both systems\n\nSarah trained to maintain and iterate on both\n\nMonthly TAM - 12 hrs/month (Francis)\n\nHands-on keyboard for additional use cases (use case #3, #4, etc.)\n\nTraining sessions to get Sarah building confidently\n\nOffice hours and troubleshooting support\n\nAI Automation Strategist (CSM)\n\nCoordinates across our team and theirs\n\nUse case roadmap and prioritization\n\nAdoption metrics and QBRs\n\nThe pitch is that this is a partnership model, not a vendor relationship. We're not just giving them software and a support number - we're actively helping them build and scale their AI automation program.\n\nWhy This Resonates With Horizon Ventures\n\nRobert asked directly: \"Do you have consulting services to help build workflows?\" - they want hands-on help\n\nSarah said she doesn't want to be dependent on us forever - the training + self-sufficiency angle matters\n\nRobert tried AutomateFlow personally and gave up - they need more than documentation and office hours\n\nWhat Would It Take to Deliver This?\n\nA few things I want to confirm before Jan 24:\n\n@user - You good with the 90-day scope? Two use cases (license governance + invoice processing), Sarah trained to maintain and iterate.\n\n@user - For the 12 hrs/month, I'm positioning some of that as you building with Sarah, not just advising. Does that work for how you want to engage?\n\n@user - Is TAM hands-on building part of how we're evolving the role? Want to FlowBuilder sure I'm aligned with where the team is headed.\n\n@user - I'm calling the CSM an \"AI Automation Strategist\" - coordinating across teams, roadmapping use cases, tracking adoption. Is that the direction for enterprise accounts?\n\nTimeline\n\nJan 20: Sarah presents business case to COO\n\nJan 24: Pricing and services deep-dive with Robert, David, Sarah\n\nJan 30: Target signature\n\nHappy to jump on a quick call if easier to discuss.

Drive the narrative, present partnership model, handle value proposition. Lead on slides 1-5.\n\nKey moments: Partnership vision, urgency questions, evaluation criteria walkthrough\n\nKYUNGHO\n\nExecutive air cover. Voice over pilot positioning if needed. Stress-test Sarah on technical feasibility. Handle pricing objections.\n\nKey moments: If pilot pushback: \"At $79K we don't typically pilot...\" If Sarah confirms build is doable, push back on pilot necessity.\n\nJordan\n\nTechnical credibility. Answer detailed implementation questions. Confirm build capability and timeline.\n\nKey moments: If asked about build complexity, confirm we can deliver if given time. Support the \"this isn't a capability issue\" narrative.\n\n\n\nSlide 1: Title\n\nHorizon Ventures Pioneering x AutomateFlow - Pilot Evaluation\n\nTalking Points\n\nQuick frame-set: \"Today we're here to align on how we evaluate this partnership - not to close a deal, but to FlowBuilder sure we're measuring what matters for your Q3 citizen development goal.\"\n\nAcknowledge Robert's concern about buying software too quickly - we heard that and want to address it head-on.\n\nLead: Alex\n\nSlide 2: The Partnership\n\nAutomateFlow + Horizon Ventures - 01 Build Together / 02 Enable Sarah / 03 Evolve Together\n\nTalking Points\n\nWalk through the three phases - this is the full-year vision, not just a pilot.\n\n~$390K in quantified value - license governance ($305K) + invoice processing ($85K+).\n\nEnd state quote: \"Your team builds confidently. AutomateFlow helps you think bigger. Partnership, not dependency.\"\n\nCRITICAL: PAUSE AND ASK URGENCY QUESTIONS HERE\n\nBefore moving to price, surface their urgency using Sarah's role:\n\n\"When you created Sarah's role, what did success by end of year look like?\"\n\n\"Is it acceptable if no one outside IT is self-serving by Q3? Does that match your expectations?\"\n\n\"What's the cost if Q3 citizen development slips to Q4 or next year?\"\n\nFraming: \"We're not trying to rush you - we're trying to understand if the pilot timeline matches what you need from Sarah's team.\"\n\nLead: Alex | Support: Kyungho listens for urgency signals\n\nSlide 3: Investment\n\n$69K platform + $10K enhanced support = $79K total\n\nTalking Points\n\nPresent full price confidently. This is what the partnership costs - we need to know if it's in range before discussing structure.\n\n\"We're pricing enhanced support at $10K instead of $15K because we want you thinking about the partnership, not the meter running.\"\n\nWatch their reaction. If they flinch at $79K, we need to requalify budget before going further.\n\nBUDGET CHECK QUESTION\n\n\"Before we go further - is this budget range realistic for a platform that delivers on the citizen development vision?\"\n\nIf they say \"we thought this was $20K\" - STOP. Requalify. Don't proceed to pilot discussion.\n\nLead: Alex | Kyungho ready to voice over if needed\n\n\n\nSlide 4: Where We Are\n\nStructured Evaluation for Long-Term Success\n\nTalking Points\n\n\"You've made clear that citizen development is the Q3 goal - getting every employee able to build their own automations.\"\n\nFrame the pilot as answering ONE question: \"Which platform James best enable Horizon Ventures employees to build confidently - not just IT, but everyone?\"\n\nThree-part structure: Build Together (head-to-head), Prove Velocity (additional use cases), Test Adoption (exec workshop).\n\nKYUNGHO: Stress-test Sarah on technical feasibility\n\n\"Sarah, I want to FlowBuilder sure I understand the situation. Jordan told me the technical requirements are met - we just need more time to build. Is that your understanding too?\"\n\nIf Sarah confirms: \"So this isn't a question of whether we CAN deliver - it's about giving you confidence in the decision. That's what the evaluation structure is for.\"\n\nLead: Alex | Kyungho asks the technical question\n\nSlide 5: Pilot Structure\n\nWhat We're Building & How - Head-to-Head + AutomateFlow Additional\n\nTalking Points\n\nHead-to-head: License Governance. Key difference - Sarah builds hands-on with AutomateFlow, follows along passively with IntegrateHub contractor.\n\nAutomateFlow additional: Invoice processing + executive workshop. We're showing velocity, not just parity.\n\n\"We're testing build experience, learning curve, support quality - the things that matter for citizen development.\"\n\nLead: Alex | Jordan available for technical detail questions\n\nSlide 6: Proposed Criteria\n\nEvaluation Framework - weighted criteria for decision\n\nTalking Points\n\nWalk through each criterion and weight. Top 3 (75%) directly address citizen development.\n\nCriterion\n\nWeight\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nCitizen Development Readiness\n\n30%\n\nCan non-IT build independently?\n\nBuild Speed & Complexity\n\n25%\n\nTime to implement, debug effort\n\nSupport Model Quality\n\n20%\n\nHands-on vs passive support\n\nSecurity & Compliance\n\n15%\n\nBYOM, SSO, audit\n\nPlatform Velocity\n\n10%\n\nUse cases delivered\n\n\"We want to measure what matters for your Q3 rollout, not just technical checkboxes.\"\n\nAsk: \"Does this weighting reflect what matters most to you? What would you change?\"\n\nLead: Alex | Get explicit sign-off on criteria\n\n\n\nSlide 7: Pilot Timeline\n\nPath Forward - Jan 23 through March 31\n\nTalking Points\n\nToday (Jan 23): Evaluation Criteria & Commercial Alignment\n\nJan 27-31: Pilot contract signed, MSA to legal\n\nFeb 1: Pilot kickoff - begin license governance build\n\nMarch 31: Pilot results presentation to exec team\n\nDecision point: Confident recommendation on platform for Q3 citizen development rollout\n\nKYUNGHO: If they push for pilot pricing\n\n\"At $79K, we don't typically do pilots - those are for $250K enterprise deals.\"\n\nOptions to voice over:\n\nQuarterly payments with opt-out clause (not a \"pilot\")\n\nAnnual agreement with opt-out if metrics not hit\n\n\"Pilot pricing is always at a premium, not a discount. We need your requirements first.\"\n\nLead: Alex | Kyungho handles commercial objections\n\nClosing & Next Steps\n\nQuestions to Answer Before We Leave\n\nIs $79K in budget range? (Must answer before pilot discussion)\n\nAre these evaluation criteria aligned with what matters to you?\n\nWhat specific requirements would you need to see in a pilot?\n\nWho needs to be involved in the MSA/contract review?\n\nAcceptable Outcomes\n\nBest: Full $79K deal, skip pilot\n\nGood: Full-year agreement with opt-out clause\n\nOK: Pilot with clear requirements - price separately after call\n\nAcceptable: Deal slips but we have clarity on requirements and budget",

I wanted to follow up with you directly on the details we need to get the trial running smoothly.\n\n1. Technical Details for the Invoice Build\n\nFrom your finance kickoff today, can you share:\n\nCurrent state workflow — how does an invoice move from receipt to approval to ProcureSoft today?\n\nWho approves what? Any dollar thresholds or routing logic?\n\nWhat does the Outlook approval process look like currently?\n\nAny edge cases or exceptions the finance team flagged?\n\nAlso — please add Jordan and me to the follow-up design session next week. We want to be there when you map the detailed flow.\n\n2. Data Connections & Access\n\nThe biggest friction in trials is usually app connections. To get ahead of this:\n\nOutlook: We hit an approval wait last time. Can you check if the OAuth connection is approved, or do we need to request again?\n\nProcureSoft: This is the big question mark you flagged. Can AutomateFlow write and upload to ProcureSoft through your setup? Who on David's team should we talk to about this?\n\nOther apps: Any other systems involved in the invoice flow we should know about?\n\nTrial user list: Who needs accounts? Just you, or should we include others from IT/Finance for the trial?\n\n3. Legal & Security\n\nI want to start the security paperwork now so it's not blocking us later. Questions:\n\nWho should I send our security docs to? (SOC 2 report, Trust Center, data processing info)\n\nDoes Horizon Ventures have a standard security questionnaire, or should I just send our package?\n\nFor enterprise trial access — any IT approvals needed beyond what David mentioned?\n\nIf we get to a deal — who handles contracts on your side? Procurement, legal, or someone else?\n\n4. IT Leadership Workshop\n\nYou mentioned the IT extended LT meeting might be a good forum. When is that? If you can get us 45-60 minutes, we'll prep a hands-on session. Bonus if folks can share pain points ahead of time — we can FlowBuilder it targeted.\n\nI know that's a lot — happy to hop on a quick call if easier. Let me know what you can get me and we'll take it from there.\n\nAlex",

I need your eyes on the messaging and timeline before then.\n\nThe Ask\n\nPlease review the presentation and let me know:\n\nDoes the overall messaging land? (\"Partnership, not dependency\")\n\nIs the timeline realistic for your involvement?\n\nAny red flags or things I'm over-promising?\n\nPresentation: Google Slides\n\n(Timeline slide attached as image)\n\nDeal Summary\n\nCustomer: Horizon Ventures Pioneering (life sciences VC)\n\nInvestment: $79K/year ($69K Enterprise + $10K Enhanced Support)\n\nChampion: Sarah – presenting business case to COO on Jan 20\n\nTarget Close: Jan 30\n\nKey Messaging\n\nRobert and Sarah explicitly said they don't want to be dependent on AutomateFlow for every build. Our positioning: \"Partnership, not dependency.\"\n\nThe Three Pillars:\n\nWe Build Together – TAMs work alongside their team throughout, not just Q1\n\nWe Enable Your Team – Train-the-trainer, dept workshops, AutomateFlow University\n\nWe Scale Your Impact – From Sarah's core team to 100+ users\n\nYour Involvement\n\nJordan (SA):\n\nQ1: Full 90-day onboarding – build both MVPs with Sarah, hands-on training\n\nQ2: Architecture reviews, complex builds only\n\nQ3-Q4: On-demand escalations\n\nFrancis (TAM):\n\nQ1: 12 hrs/mo – office hours, async TeamChat, help Sarah modify workflows\n\nQ2: 12 hrs/mo – still building alongside team, train-the-trainer support\n\nQ3: 12 hrs/mo – workshop support, help identify what's next\n\nQ4: 12 hrs/mo – strategic guidance, Year 2 roadmap, QBR + renewal\n\nQ1 Use Cases\n\nLicense Governance: $776K dormant spend → $305K recoverable. Goal: 550+ notifications.\n\nInvoice Processing: AP bottleneck → $132K efficiency. Goal: 100 invoices processed.\n\nStakeholder Concerns to Know\n\nRobert (VP): \"Ease of use\" – he tried AutomateFlow and gave up. Copilot demo helped.\n\nSarah: \"Don't want to rely on AutomateFlow every time\" – hence partnership framing.\n\nEmma (CISO): Security questions answered in MAP. May need dedicated call.\n\nTimeline\n\nJan 20: Sarah presents to COO\n\nJan 24: Pricing & services conversation (this presentation)\n\nWeek of Jan 27: Legal/Procurement\n\nJan 30: Target signature + kickoff",

      "content": "# Horizon Ventures Pioneering - January Close Incentives\n\n*Ideas to encourage signature by Jan 30th*\n\n---\n\n## Context from Today's Call\n\nKey dynamics:\n- Robert explicitly said \"we want to be aggressive\" but also \"we need time to be comfortable\"\n- Sarah is motivated to move fast (Q1 delivery pressure) but Robert is the braking mechanism\n- 4-day week next week limits their internal bandwidth\n- Procurement doesn't start until business comfort is achieved\n- They want to understand pricing and services model better before committing\n\n---\n\n## Incentive Options\n\n### 1. Executive Workshop (Mentioned on Call)\n\n*What you said:* \"We James often do little workshops. Maybe it's like you and a couple of the executive team of like, here's how you would build an agent.\"\n\n*Structure:*\n- 1-hour hands-on session for Robert + 2-3 execs\n- Each person builds something they can actually use (calendar summary, email triage, etc.)\n- Position as \"FlowBuilder sure the platform is right for you before you commit\"\n\n*Why it works:*\n- Robert said he tried AutomateFlow and gave up - this addresses his personal pain directly\n- Low risk way to build confidence before signature\n- Creates internal advocates beyond Sarah\n\n*Timing:* Offer this for week of Jan 20-24, before signature\n\n---\n\n### 2. Extended Onboarding Period\n\n*Standard:* 90-day hands-on SA support\n\n*Incentive:* Extend to 120 days for January signature\n\n*Why it works:*\n- They're worried about getting both use cases done in Q1\n- Extra 30 days gives buffer without changing the price\n- Signals investment in their success\n\n*Cost to us:* Minimal - Jordan's already allocated\n\n---\n\n### 3. Guaranteed Use Case Delivery\n\n*Standard:* \"We'll help you build these\"\n\n*Incentive:* Explicitly guarantee in writing: \"Two use cases in production by end of Q1 or we extend support at no cost\"\n\n*Why it works:*\n- Removes Sarah's delivery risk\n- Gives her something concrete to take to the functional committee\n- Shows confidence in our ability to execute\n\n*Watch-out:* Need to scope what \"production\" means (MVP with 100 invoices? Full rollout?)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Early Signature Discount\n\n*Option A:* 10% discount for signature by Jan 31 (saves ~$8K on $80K deal)\n\n*Option B:* Waive one month of TAM ($10-20K) for January signature\n\n*Why it might work:*\n- Robert is cost-conscious (asked about consulting rates)\n- Creates urgency without pressure\n\n*Why it might NOT work:*\n- They didn't push back hard on price\n- Discount might signal desperation\n- ROI is already 7-8x, price isn't the blocker\n\n*Recommendation:* Don't lead with discount. Use as a closer if needed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Additional TAM Hours (First 90 Days)\n\n*Standard:* 12 hrs/month\n\n*Incentive:* 18 hrs/month for first 3 months, then step down to 12\n\n*Why it works:*\n- They explicitly asked about support spikes when building new use cases\n- Shows we're investing in their success\n- Addresses David's concern about \"what happens when we need more\"\n\n*Cost to us:* Need to check with Lindsay on capacity\n\n---\n\n### 6. Q1 Business Review with Leadership\n\n*What it is:* Commit to an executive-level QBR at end of Q1 where you present:\n- Use case outcomes vs. ROI projections\n- Adoption metrics\n- Roadmap for next use cases\n\n*Why it works:*\n- Shows accountability\n- Gives Sarah something to point to: \"They're committed to proving ROI\"\n- Plants seeds for expansion conversation\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Package for January Close\n\nBundle these together as \"Q1 Accelerator Package\":\n\n1. *Executive Workshop* - Week of Jan 20-24 (free, included)\n2. *Guaranteed Q1 Delivery* - Two use cases in MVP by March 31 or support extends\n3. *Q1 Business Review* - Exec-level QBR to validate ROI\n\n*Don't offer discount upfront.* The value story is strong enough. If they push on price, you have room to move.\n\n---\n\n## How to Position\n\n*Frame:* \"We know you want to move fast but also want to be confident. Here's what we're willing to commit to FlowBuilder sure you're successful.\"\n\n*Not:* \"Here's a deal if you sign this month.\" That feels transactional when they want a partnership.\n\n---\n\n## Questions for Your Manager\n\nBefore offering any of these:\n- Can we commit to the guaranteed Q1 delivery in writing?\n- Is Lindsay open to 18 TAM hours for first 90 days?\n- Do you have authority to waive the first month of TAM if needed as a closer?\n",

Emma (CISO) couldn't join but we addressed her questions in writing. They're confident but want to move deliberately. Target moved from Jan 23 → Jan 30.\n\n\n\nWhat happened today\n\n\n\nLeadership demo with Robert (VP), David (Director Enterprise Apps), Sarah. Emma (CISO) couldn't join but sent questions in advance - we documented answers in the MAP.\n\nJordan walked through both use cases (license governance + invoice processing)\n\nDeep dive on BYOM - key differentiator vs IntegrateHub. Robert and David engaged on model flexibility (Mistral via Bedrock came up)\n\nRobert engaged on ease of use - he tried AutomateFlow personally and gave up. Copilot demo helped address this\n\nGot buy-in from Robert and David on the approach. Robert said \"we want to be aggressive\" but needs time to be comfortable\n\nIntegrateHub comparison: They're not replacing IntegrateHub orchestration layer. We're positioned as the agentic AI platform that coexists\n\n\n\nKey quotes:\n\nRobert: \"We want to be aggressive. We want to sign, but we need to FlowBuilder sure we take the time that is needed.\"\n\nSarah: \"I know we had the IntegrateHub demo on my first day... there were some concerns about bring your own model functionality.\"\n\nRobert on urgency: \"Again, we can rush if we are comfortable.\"\n\n\n\nWhy timeline pushed\n\n\n\nOriginal target: Jan 23\n\nNew target: Jan 30\n\n\n\nThe push is process, not interest. Robert explicitly said they're motivated but won't skip steps:\n\nBusiness case presentation to COO is Jan 20 (Sarah presenting)\n\nProcurement doesn't start until they're \"comfortable\" - legal won't touch it beforehand\n\n4-day week next week limits bandwidth\n\nRobert wants pricing/services conversation before committing\n\n\n\nWe're scheduling a follow-up for Friday Jan 24 to go through services model and pricing in detail with Robert and David.\n\n\n\nWhat they need from us for Jan 24\n\n\n\nServices model clarity: What's included in 12 TAM hours? What happens when they need to build use case #4? They don't want to feel nickel-and-dimed.\n\nPricing walkthrough: Robert asked explicitly to \"discuss your pricing\" - he's not pushing back, he wants to understand.\n\nTraining/enablement: Sarah wants to be self-sufficient by EOY. Robert wants his team trained. We need to show the path.\n\n\n\nMEDDPICC Status\n\n\n\nMetrics 🟢 - $305K license savings, $132K invoice processing - Sarah built the business cases\n\nEconomic Buyer 🟢 - Robert engaged, CEO/COO aware\n\nDecision Criteria 🟢 - BYOM, ease of use, coexistence with IntegrateHub, support model\n\nDecision Process 🟡 - Sarah → Robert → Functional committee → Legal/Procurement\n\nPaper Process 🟡 - Sarah still learning their internal process. Procurement embedded in approval flow\n\nPain 🟢 - IntegrateHub service gaps, need Q1 AI wins, $776K in dormant license spend\n\nChampion 🟢 - Sarah is strong, engaged, doing the work\n\nCompetition 🟡 - IntegrateHub incumbent for orchestration. We're positioned as complement for agentic AI\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\n\nJan 20: Sarah presents business case to COO (not technology decision - just business case)\n\nJan 24: Follow-up with Robert/David on pricing and services model\n\nWeek of Jan 27: Legal/procurement review\n\nJan 30: Target signature\n\n\n\nRisk assessment\n\n\n\n🟡 Timeline slippage risk: Robert is deliberate. If Jan 24 conversation doesn't land, could push to Feb.\n\n🟢 Deal risk: Low. They're motivated, have budget, have clear use cases. It's about process, not willingness.\n\n🟡 IntegrateHub risk: They're not ripping out IntegrateHub, but if IntegrateHub comes back with a strong counter-offer on agentic, could complicate things.\n\n\n\nWhat I need\n\n\n\nConfirm I can offer executive workshop as January incentive (Robert wants hands-on experience)\n\nValidate services model messaging before Friday (created draft - James share)\n\nAny intelligence on IntegrateHub's agentic/AI pricing or support model?\n\n\n\nOn pulling this forward\n\n\n\nMy hypothesis: The quote expires end of month, which gives us a natural reason to encourage Jan close. But I want to be careful not to come across as pushy when we've been positioning as a partner, not a vendor. Thinking I could:\n\nFrame it as \"the current pricing is locked through Jan 31\" rather than \"discount expires\"\n\nPair it with the executive workshop offer - give them something, not just take away\n\nLet Sarah use it as internal air cover if she needs urgency with procurement\n\n\n\nWould appreciate your read on this. Is there a better way to create pull without damaging the relationship? Open to other ideas.",

I know there's a lot on your plate evaluating options, and we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to show what a partnership could look like.\n\n\n\nWhat we heard\n\n\n\nBased on today's conversation, these are the things that matter most as you FlowBuilder this decision:\n\n\n\nBring your own model - Your team needs control over which LLMs touch your data and how. This is non-negotiable from a security and governance standpoint.\n\nEase of use - If this is going to scale beyond Sarah, people who aren't technical need to be able to build and maintain workflows without constant hand-holding.\n\nServices and support model - You want clarity on what's included, what happens when you need to build use case #4, and how we help your team become self-sufficient over time.\n\nCoexistence with IntegrateHub - This needs to complement what's already working, not blow it up.\n\n\n\nFor Emma\n\n\n\nI know you weren't able to join today, but Sarah shared your questions in advance. We've documented our responses in the mutual action plan linked below - specifically around data handling, model connectivity, and guardrails. Happy to schedule a separate conversation if you'd like to go deeper on any of those.\n\n\n\nPath forward\n\n\n\nWe understand you want to move deliberately. Our goal isn't to rush you into a decision - it's to give you and your team what you need to feel confident moving forward.\n\n\n\nHere's what we're proposing:\n\n\n\nDate\n\nActivity\n\nJan 20\n\nSarah presents business case to COO\n\nJan 24\n\nFollow-up conversation on pricing and services model (Robert, David, Sarah)\n\nWeek of Jan 27\n\nLegal/procurement review\n\nJan 30\n\nTarget contract signature and kickoff\n\n\n\nWhat I'll bring to Jan 24\n\n\n\nDetailed breakdown of our services model - what's included, how TAM hours work, what happens as you scale\n\nPricing structure walkthrough so there are no surprises\n\nTraining and enablement plan - the path to your team being self-sufficient\n\n\n\nOne other thought: Robert, you mentioned trying AutomateFlow on your own and finding it challenging. We often run executive workshops - a hands-on hour where you and a few colleagues build something you can actually use. If that would be helpful in building confidence before you commit, happy to set one up.\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\nMutual Action Plan (includes Emma's Q&A): View Spreadsheet\n\nEnterprise Agreement (for legal review): AutomateFlow.com/legal/enterprise-agreement\n\nTrust Center (for IT/security review): trust.AutomateFlow.com\n\n\n\nLet me know if the 24th works for the follow-up, or if there's a better time given your schedule next week.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nAlex",

      "content": "# Horizon Ventures Pioneering - Deal Channel Update (Jan 16)\n\n*For TeamChat - formatted for copy/paste*\n\n---\n\n*Horizon Ventures Pioneering Update: Leadership demo done, timeline adjusted to Jan 30*\n\n*TL;DR:* Demo went well. Got buy-in from Robert and David. Emma (CISO) couldn't join but we addressed her questions in writing. They're confident but want to move deliberately. Target moved from Jan 23 → Jan 30.\n\n---\n\n*What happened today*\n\n• Leadership demo with Robert (VP), David (Director Enterprise Apps), Sarah. Emma (CISO) couldn't join but sent questions in advance - we documented answers in the MAP.\n• Jordan walked through both use cases (license governance + invoice processing)\n• Deep dive on BYOM - key differentiator vs IntegrateHub. Robert and David engaged on model flexibility (Mistral via Bedrock came up)\n• Robert engaged on ease of use - he tried AutomateFlow personally and gave up. Copilot demo helped address this\n• Got buy-in from Robert and David on the approach. Robert said \"we want to be aggressive\" but needs time to be comfortable\n• IntegrateHub comparison: They're not replacing IntegrateHub orchestration layer. We're positioned as the agentic AI platform that coexists\n\n*Key quotes:*\n• Robert: \"We want to be aggressive. We want to sign, but we need to FlowBuilder sure we take the time that is needed.\"\n• Sarah: \"I know we had the IntegrateHub demo on my first day... there were some concerns about bring your own model functionality.\"\n• Robert on urgency: \"Again, we can rush if we are comfortable.\"\n\n---\n\n*Why timeline pushed*\n\n• Original target: Jan 23\n• New target: Jan 30\n\nThe push is process, not interest. Robert explicitly said they're motivated but won't skip steps:\n1. Business case presentation to COO is Jan 20 (Sarah presenting)\n2. Procurement doesn't start until they're \"comfortable\" - legal won't touch it beforehand\n3. 4-day week next week limits bandwidth\n4. Robert wants pricing/services conversation before committing\n\nWe're scheduling a follow-up for Friday Jan 24 to go through services model and pricing in detail with Robert and David.\n\n---\n\n*What they need from us for Jan 24*\n\n1. *Services model clarity:* What's included in 12 TAM hours? What happens when they need to build use case #4? They don't want to feel nickel-and-dimed.\n2. *Pricing walkthrough:* Robert asked explicitly to \"discuss your pricing\" - he's not pushing back, he wants to understand.\n3. *Training/enablement:* Sarah wants to be self-sufficient by EOY. Robert wants his team trained. We need to show the path.\n\n---\n\n*MEDDPICC Status*\n\n• *Metrics* 🟢 - $305K license savings, $132K invoice processing - Sarah built the business cases\n• *Economic Buyer* 🟢 - Robert engaged, CEO/COO aware\n• *Decision Criteria* 🟢 - BYOM, ease of use, coexistence with IntegrateHub, support model\n• *Decision Process* 🟡 - Sarah → Robert → Functional committee → Legal/Procurement\n• *Paper Process* 🟡 - Sarah still learning their internal process. Procurement embedded in approval flow\n• *Pain* 🟢 - IntegrateHub service gaps, need Q1 AI wins, $776K in dormant license spend\n• *Champion* 🟢 - Sarah is strong, engaged, doing the work\n• *Competition* 🟡 - IntegrateHub incumbent for orchestration. We're positioned as complement for agentic AI\n\n---\n\n*Next steps*\n\n• Jan 20: Sarah presents business case to COO (not technology decision - just business case)\n• Jan 24: Follow-up with Robert/David on pricing and services model\n• Week of Jan 27: Legal/procurement review\n• Jan 30: Target signature\n\n---\n\n*Risk assessment*\n\n🟡 *Timeline slippage risk:* Robert is deliberate. If Jan 24 conversation doesn't land, could push to Feb.\n🟢 *Deal risk:* Low. They're motivated, have budget, have clear use cases. It's about process, not willingness.\n🟡 *IntegrateHub risk:* They're not ripping out IntegrateHub, but if IntegrateHub comes back with a strong counter-offer on agentic, could complicate things.\n\n---\n\n*What I need*\n\n• Confirm I can offer executive workshop as January incentive (Robert wants hands-on experience)\n• Validate services model messaging before Friday (created draft - James share)\n• Any intelligence on IntegrateHub's agentic/AI pricing or support model?\n\n*On pulling this forward*\n\nMy hypothesis: The quote expires end of month, which gives us a natural reason to encourage Jan close. But I want to be careful not to come across as pushy when we've been positioning as a partner, not a vendor. Thinking I could:\n• Frame it as \"the current pricing is locked through Jan 31\" rather than \"discount expires\"\n• Pair it with the executive workshop offer - give them something, not just take away\n• Let Sarah use it as internal air cover if she needs urgency with procurement\n\nWould appreciate your read on this. Is there a better way to create pull without damaging the relationship? Open to other ideas.\n",

Full credit or partial?\n\nTask allocation: Can we allocate against the 600K annual cap during pilot, with usage counting toward full year if they convert?\n\nOpt-out terms: What's standard language for the opt-out clause?

      "content": "# Horizon Ventures Pioneering - Services Model Detail\n\n*Prepared for Jan 24 follow-up conversation*\n\n---\n\n## The Core Question We're Answering\n\nRobert and David want clarity on: \"What happens when we need to build new use cases? James we get charged every time?\"\n\n---\n\n## What's Included: Three Phases of Support\n\n### Phase 1: First 90 Days (Hands-On Build)\n\n*Who:* Jordan (Solutions Architect)\n\n*What's delivered:*\n• License Governance workflow - built and connected to your systems\n• Invoice Processing workflow - built and connected to your systems\n• Full documentation of both systems\n• Sarah trained to maintain and iterate on both\n\n*Commitment:* We build these with you, not just show you how. Jordan is hands-on keyboard.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Monthly TAM Support (12 hours/month)\n\n*Who:* Francis (Technical Account Manager)\n\n*What's included:*\n• Building additional use cases (use case #3, #4, etc.)\n• Troubleshooting and optimization of existing workflows\n• Training sessions for your team\n• Office hours participation\n\n*What's NOT included:*\n• Major net-new implementations requiring 20+ hours\n• Building for other Horizon Ventures portfolio companies (separate agreements)\n\n*How hours are used - typical month:*\n| Activity | Hours |\n|----------|-------|\n| 1:1 working session with Sarah | 4 |\n| Building/iterating on use case | 4 |\n| Office hours / ad-hoc support | 2 |\n| Strategic planning with AI Strategist | 2 |\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: AI Transformation Strategy (Ongoing)\n\n*Who:* AI Transformation Strategist (dedicated resource)\n\n*What's included:*\n• Identifying next use cases in pipeline\n• Benchmarking against similar enterprise deployments\n• Quarterly business reviews\n• Adoption metrics and recommendations\n\n*This is strategic, not tactical.* While Francis helps you build, the strategist helps you prioritize what to build next.\n\n---\n\n## The TeamChat Channel (Free, Unlimited)\n\nWe set up a shared TeamChat channel with:\n• Alex (AE)\n• Jordan (SA)\n• Francis (TAM)\n• AI Transformation Strategist\n\nQuick questions, async updates, blockers - none of this counts against TAM hours. This is relationship support, not billable time.\n\n---\n\n## Addressing Robert's Core Concern: New Use Case Spikes\n\n*Scenario:* It's April. Sarah wants to build use case #4 (e.g., onboarding automation). How does that work?\n\n*Answer:*\n1. Sarah describes the use case to Francis\n2. Francis scopes it - \"This is a 6-hour build\" or \"This is a 15-hour build\"\n3. If it fits within monthly hours, Francis builds it with Sarah\n4. If it's larger, we discuss: spread across 2 months, or discuss incremental support\n\n*Key point:* We're not going to come back and say \"that'll be $50K extra.\" The 12 hours is designed to handle ongoing use case development - that's why we doubled the standard allocation.\n\n---\n\n## If You Need More: Add-On Support\n\n*Pricing:* $10-20K per 6 additional hours/month (committed annually = 72 hours/year)\n\n*When this makes sense:*\n• Major transformation initiative beyond initial scope\n• Scaling to multiple business units simultaneously\n• Building complex multi-system integrations\n\n*When this doesn't FlowBuilder sense:*\n• Normal quarter-over-quarter use case development\n• Training and enablement\n• Most customers at your scale don't need this\n\n---\n\n## The Training Path to Self-Sufficiency\n\nSarah raised this explicitly: \"I don't want to be dependent on the AutomateFlow team forever.\"\n\n*Our goal alignment:* We agree. Here's the enablement path:\n\n| Milestone | Target | What It Looks Like |\n|-----------|--------|-------------------|\n| End of 90 days | Sarah confident on 3-step zaps | Can build calendar summaries, notifications, simple lookups |\n| Month 6 | Sarah building complex workflows | Can architect multi-step automations with tables, AI steps |\n| End of Year 1 | Team self-sufficient on 80% of use cases | Only need TAM for complex integrations or new system connections |\n\n*Success metric:* If you still need us for everything at month 12, we've failed.\n\n---\n\n## Consulting Partners (Robert's Question)\n\nYes, we have certified partners who can provide additional implementation support.\n\n*When to use:*\n• Large-scale deployment across portfolio companies\n• Need dedicated resources beyond TAM allocation\n• Prefer external consulting model\n\n*My recommendation:* Let's see how the first 90 days go. Most enterprise customers at your stage don't need external consultants - the TAM model covers it.\n\nI can share specific partner recommendations if this becomes relevant.\n\n---\n\n## Summary for the Pricing Conversation\n\n| Component | What You Get |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| Platform License | Enterprise features, BYOM, governance controls |\n| 90-Day Onboarding | Jordan builds first 2 use cases hands-on |\n| 12 hrs/mo TAM | Francis for ongoing build + support |\n| AI Strategist | Strategic planning, adoption metrics |\n| TeamChat Channel | Unlimited async support |\n| Office Hours | Team training, drop-in help |\n\n*This is designed for where you are:* Early in your AI journey, need hands-on help now, want to be self-sufficient by EOY.\n",

        "whatHappenedNext": "**Trial check-in - pivoting to paid pilot.** Key outcomes: (1) **Evaluation criteria locked:** Citizen dev usability (40%), central IT build capability (40%), security/compliance (table stakes), platform velocity. Sarah James fill out eval, Robert decides based on her confidence. (2) **Timeline confirmed: End of March.** Sarah going back to COO + functional leadership then - no Feb close possible. (3) **Pilot pricing anchored at $20K for 2 months** (1.5x prorated) - includes Jordan's dedicated time. KR aligned on this approach. (4) **Technical win: ProcureSoft API now working.** OAuth resolved (needed newline-separated scopes), successfully retrieving PO data, invoice workflow nearly end-to-end. (5) **New use case: BrandFolder facial recognition** - batch photo tagging with Google Vision API. Good 2-month pilot project. (6) **Next steps:** Sarah pitches Robert in 1:1 tomorrow, Emma reviews security/legal, Jordan demos full flow to Lisa tomorrow. If Robert verbal yes → formal quote → contract execution.. **Working session with Sarah, David, Mike (IntegrateHub SME).** Key progress: (1) Crawl/walk/run approach agreed for invoice automation - start with recurring invoices, add human-in-loop, then automate high-confidence matches. (2) AutomateFlow Form + Table set up for PDF testing - bypasses Outlook blocker. (3) Sarah has ProcureSoft admin access, Jordan sent API endpoint requirements (invoices, POs, images). (4) 15 users added to trial including David (admin) and Mike. (5) Mike met Jordan for first time - has IntegrateHub experience, used AutomateFlow ~2 years ago. **Blockers:** Outlook OAuth still no timeline, ProcureSoft API not yet connected. **Other opportunities:** Sarah experimenting with Brandfolder MCP + facial recognition (Google Vision API), asked about MCP pricing (Jordan to follow up). **Workshop:** Rachel Mabie confirmed for Feb 18. Need to get exec Outlook accounts approved before workshop. **Action:** Ask Sarah to amend Outlook request to include leadership team.. (Evening)**: **Security email + memo sent to Emma.** Short email with links + detailed memo uploaded to Google Doc. Offered call if needed. Next: follow up if no response.. (Evening)**: **Workshop planning started.** Feb 18 workshop needs prep: (1) All connections set up beforehand (Outlook OAuth, ProcureSoft), (2) Consider Rachel Mabie for \"build your own agent\" format, (3) Get attendee pain points in advance. Jordan + Sarah to work Monday on connections and trial user list.. (Evening)**: **Sarah responded with key details:** **IT Workshop: Feb 18 at 9:30am ET** - Robert approved, Sarah adding us to agenda **EA = Enterprise Applications** (David's team), not Executive Assistants - kills the quick win angle **ProcureSoft**: Sarah requesting admin access. Question on whether constraints are admin setup or API - she thought API but checking **Outlook OAuth**: Not approved by security yet, Sarah pinged and following up **Security/Legal**: Emma Starr (InfoSec) + Legal handles contracts. \"Send package\" approach works **Trial users**: Sarah James compile list, should include others beyond just her **Finance design session**: Team said review flowchart together once built **Created security brief for Emma** - SOC 2, GDPR, BYOM, enterprise controls, links to Trust Center/Enterprise Agreement. Output: `/outputs/security-brief-Emma.docx`. (Late PM)**: KR sent follow-up email to Robert, David, Sarah, Emma confirming trial structure. Outlined: (1) Two-week enterprise trial with full support from Jordan, (2) Invoice automation build continues with Sarah + Jordan, (3) IT Leadership Workshop for hands-on citizen dev testing, (4) Jan 29 check-in to assess progress and decide next steps. Framed as \"define value together\" and \"lower your team's risk with a paid pilot.\" **Sarah and David accepted the Jan 29 meeting.** I'm following up with Sarah on tactical details.. (PM)**: KR debrief. Feedback: Should have asked \"paid vs non-paid pilot\" earlier to shortcut discussion. Risk flagged: Customer using \"agents/agentic\" without understanding - we don't price agents. Opportunity: EA use case on IntegrateHub may be expensive recipe we can replace quickly. Action items: Start security paperwork, clarify EA use case, prepare for Jan 29 with clear \"if they want more time, they put money down\" positioning. Different views on call approach - KR thinks trial is cleaner than pilot, I'm concerned Robert James just ask for more time regardless.. Alignment call with Robert, David, Sarah, Emma. Robert and Emma had 9am conflict, left after 30 min. **Key outcome: Pivoted from 3-month paid pilot to 2-week enterprise trial.** Robert firm: \"Won't pay before we prove ourselves.\" KR pushed back on pilot approach - citizen development gets delayed, full connections still needed anyway. Landed on: (1) Enterprise trial with Jordan support continuing, (2) Thursday Jan 29 check-in, (3) Sarah/Jordan continue invoice automation build, (4) IT leadership workshop in next couple weeks, (5) Brian + David join technical builds for comparison. **$80K confirmed in range if we prove value.** Evaluation criteria rubric not validated. David was candid: \"IntegrateHub is known, we're giving AutomateFlow a fair shot.\" Biggest technical question mark: ProcureSoft integration.",
