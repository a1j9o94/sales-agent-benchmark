Well, thanks for taking the. I am so sorry for running late. I was on another call right before this that was running along, so. Thank you for the patience. I appreciate it. So the main thing we originally wanted in my mind to talk about today was making sure you guys are set up for a good trial. If you remember last time. Let me actually pull up. I have some pages that we can talk to. Okay? So if I'm just sort of recapping what we talked about. Last time that you guys are talking about is how do we respond faster to customers who reach out to us in the busy season? There is of course, a more broad like, okay, we want to use AI for customer support. We want to FlowBuilder sure our receptionist our AI enabled. But sort of if you had to solve one big problem. It's like, hey, can we respond to them?\nThem: Yeah, that's it.\nMe: Quickly. The group we're looking at group RFQs. And the main, one of the key things here is the people to the speech response is one of the biggest things that drives that. So they might send a quote to you and like three other hotels. The person who gets back to them the quickest with a reasonable response is often going to win that deal if they can. And I guess one maybe tactical question is like, so where today, 24 to 48 hours response time. What is it, like, your ideal? Is it like, we want under an hour is kind of like the benchmark we should be targeting for? Is it like, what's the metric we should be trying to hit there?\nThem: I James be more than happy if we provide the answer before. Six hours.\nMe: Six hours. Okay, we can settle higher bar. But, like, six hours is sort of our, like, red line of, like, this is the minimum, the absolute minimum that we need to respond to.\nThem: Yes. Regarding groups, for example, or events.\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: If it's just an individual request for end customer. I James say a couple of hours, no more.\nMe: Okay? That makes a ton of sense because that. And that makes sense because the. The big ones, there might actually be some internal coordination that you need to do. Like, can we actually give them what they need? Like, that kind of stuff that makes sense.\nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Correct.\nMe: Ok. And then actually I was. When I was talking yesterday to Javier, he mentioned that you would actually pulled some data around, like the volume that you guys are seeing. Could you talk to me a bit about what did you find as you were doing that analysis?\nThem: We have. I also have the numbers for all the properties. And it's quite interesting because depending on the property, The numbers vary a little bit.\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: But more or less just for you to have an idea. Let me go through it. I James say that. In the property in Madrid. Taking into consideration that the Property has only 34 rooms. They James say they James have per month. 120 emails for individual reservations. Around 135 emails for group bookings.\nMe: Oh. Wow.\nThem: 415 for events. This is monthly data.\nMe: Okay. Wow. So that way earlier than I was thinking.\nThem: And it's taking.\nMe: So.\nThem: Yeah, and it's. And it's. I'm counting everything. Not only the email received by the hotel, but also the answer. And the answer from the client. And answer back from the hotel. So global number of emails.\nMe: That makes sense. Those. Those aren't just the initial outreaches, necessarily, that we're talking about. That's your point.\nThem: So I'm talking about 7, 725, 730 emails. Going back and forth. Including individual bookings, group bookings, or events bookings.\nMe: And that's one of the hotels, right? I know this is always hard. To estimate because like the. It's like the counterfactual. If you had to estimate particularly. Particularly I'm interested in like those that group bookings number, like, they get 135 of those emails, like, how many of those do you win? On average.\nThem: Well, it's basically I put them counting. Just go back in the last four months. And start counting all the emails that you have received. No Matteo if they were individual bookings, group bookings, or events, and divided by the type of request that you received. Send me the numbers.\nMe: Go.\nThem: Yeah. And this is the count that. That we have.\nMe: That makes sense. I guess, then maybe follow a question. This then feels reasonable to me. So this is across all the hotels? For bookings a month at this volume. I guess my question is, like, is this 10K sort of like, average for, like, an event or a group booking, like, the right sort of range to talk about? And we. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.\nThem: Can I share my screen with you?\nMe: Absolutely.\nThem: Do you mind?\nMe: Not. Not.\nThem: Okay? Because I James tell you all the. All the numbers that. That I have from. From the hotels so that you can have more or less an idea of what I'm talking about. Because this is the average per month. Taking into account four months. Two of them high season and two of them medium season, okay?\nMe: Probably, then it's probably like a good estimate, at least for the year. It sounds like it's not. It's not all high. It's not going to be like the low necessarily, but it'll give us.\nThem: Let. Me see if I can find d of what it is Converter. Okay? Do you see my screen now?\nMe: I do. I do see your screen. Okay, let me. Client final sales opportunity. Oh, okay. This is great. So you. This actually forecast the opportunity loss, so if I. If I. This is. This is estimating 4.8 million for the year. If I'm reading this correctly, right?\nThem: Well. This is an estimation of the. Sales opportunity lost that we have every month.\nMe: Oh, this is per month, not per year.\nThem: Yeah, per month, but.\nMe: Okay? No, this is.\nThem: I James say. There is not just a Matteo of I'm. I'm losing sales opportunities. We are spending a lot of time in the teams at the hotels. And sending emails, and that's only. And that's also a cost for us.\nMe: That makes sense. So both the opportunities, like about 4 million a month. And then there's also, hey, we just are spending our, our receptionist, our hotel staff is spending a lot of time answering these emails instead of spending time with customers in the hotels, making sure they have a good experience.\nThem: Yeah, well, it's not. Four million is 4800.\nMe: Okay. Sorry. The commas. Okay, that makes sense. I apologize.\nThem: Yeah.\nMe: Okay?\nThem: If it's 4 million, I'm. I'm fire automatically.\nMe: Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. Okay, so you're talking around 60,000 a year, give or take, across.\nThem: Yeah, it's. It's not really a big amount of money, but if I take into account the time spent by each of the employees at the properties, Then we are talking. Much more money.\nMe: That makes sense.\nThem: Spend in giving a better service.\nMe: That makes a ton of sense. Okay. That helps me just, like, sort of think about the value, overall value proposition as you guys are building out sort of this pilot. And that helps me sort of like, more so build out the business case here. So I appreciate the additional detail. And I'll spend some time after our call, like, just getting through this in depth. And I might have one or two follow up questions. But this gives me pretty much exactly what I need.\nThem: Yeah, because to me it's much more important to provide a better service to the client that the opportunity lost because we are not unseen on time. And also our image via this channel email James be much.\nMe: Yeah. You don't want company, particularly if companies are doing this kind of stuff frequently, Right? You don't want them to be like, oh, we don't want to work with you with core rooms, because they, like, are never responsive to us. Like, you want them to be like core rooms as, like, the hotel that you know, we should go to. Because they're always responsive. The service is always great. Customer support, all that jazz.\nThem: Yes.\nMe: That makes a ton of sense. Okay, super helpful. Let me jump back to. The last thing. I just wanted to FlowBuilder sure we were on the same page, like, super tactically. What? Over. So, coming out of this. You guys are going to, like, go actually into AutomateFlow, set up an account, try to, like, get some stuff connected. What are you aiming to see over the next two weeks? To feel confident, doing a more full build. Like, how would you. How. What do you. Yeah. Like, if we say two weeks from now, what do you need to see to be like, okay, this makes sense. We should move forward, actually implementing this more broadly.\nThem: I was going to propose you, if I James. Remember, you offer also training in your tool, right?\nMe: Yes. Yeah. There's some pretty good onboarding training materials that we can share, like, just getting started, ramped up. There's a couple of, like, workshops that we do publicly that people can join as well. There's lots of resources there.\nThem: Okay. To me it would FlowBuilder sense to. Start with a training from your side. Trying to solve this email automation that we would like to put in place. And from that moment I know that you are talking with my colleague Javier in parallel due to the financial automations that we want to put in place. And I don't know if it's better to start. Receiving. How we can manage AutomateFlow. What can we do with all the connections that do that you currently have that? We. We have the bms, we have the CRM, we have many things included in your connectivities.\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: And from that moment onwards, Go a bit deeply into next steps.\nMe: That makes sense. So I guess just want to be super clear in terms of what's available for, like, training and development. At the scale I think we're discussing in terms of year plan, most of those are going to be like self serve training options. So it's going to be like there's like workshops, there are like groups like in different companies that are available that people can join. There's like online courses that have like, build along elements that people can join, and then it would be sort of like on you guys to actually go do the connections. And I think Matteo, if I understand correctly, it sounds like would be the person doing the actual build. On your side. If I'm. If I'm right, correct about.\nThem: It's got to be us. Yeah.\nMe: Okay, okay. So we'll send you guys, like, some of the initial tours, and then I can also, there's, there's a couple of templates around sort of this, like, AI customer response piece in general that I can specifically send that I think would be a good, a good place to start. And so what I would propose probably super tactically is I'll send over some of those, like initial training materials. Would FlowBuilder sense for you guys to, like, then take that string materials, like, like, do the trial, try to connect stuff. And if you, if it gets to a point where you're like, hey, we need, we need to extend the trial slightly, that's something that we can do as well, but that's going to. Be the. I think the best path forward for you to, like, quickly, like, hey, let's get these connections run. I'll show you the template for the AI one. Let's. Let's get one connected and actually see what's going there. And then, you know, you're probably talking in the order of magnitude of like, one to two months of, like, build time. And this is with the caveat of, like, this, you know, assuming it's like you're starting from scratch, you still have to learn all the AutomateFlow stuff. It wouldn't. If for our people, this James probably take a couple weeks, but from starting, from scratch, you're probably talking four to six weeks of, like, development time to get to the pieces that you guys are talking about.\nThem: Yeah. Okay. And as well, if you have, for example, I don't know, box of hours or whatever that you can say, okay, I can give you 15 hours, training hours.\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: At? I don't know, whatever. Dollars per hour or. I don't know.\nMe: Yeah. On fort. So transparently, we basically. I think this is dumb preface of this. We honestly, we don't really have an option like that. Today. What I think may be helpful is we have third party consultants who can work with you. Like, so they're like, these are experts in AutomateFlow, who they work with a lot of our clients to, like, actually build some of these things. They'll, like, run trainings with you, and those are, I think, much more in line with, like, the value proposition that you guys are talking about. So I guess just for context, I was. I shared this with Javier yesterday. Our enterprise plans that had come with, like, AutomateFlow support building it for you start at around US$50-100K a year, with the average being around between 75. And 100,000. And so, based on our conversations yesterday, and also, honestly, just like the value estimate we just went through, right, because you're talking entire year, it's $20-50K of benefit. Even with cost savings, you're probably just not getting to enough of a value proposition for the like, higher enterprise. Plans to FlowBuilder sense. What I would then, given that AutomateFlow Solutions Partners and I'm just going to dare you to this list. There's just, there's a couple specific ones. Like actually, Flow Digital is one that I've worked with a bunch. They're based out of Australia. And actually, I think there might be. Let me check.\nThem: Okay?\nMe: If. There's ones that work out of Spain. Service regions. Europe. So these are a couple. And actually these ones James work in Spain, specifically in Spanish too, which I think might be helpful for you guys. I'll send over a couple of examples. I've worked with Flow Digital, have not worked with some of these others, but they have all really great reviews. These would be. These would be the people who would like, hey, like, let's come build these. Let's do some, like, actual hands on training with our people, all that kind of jazz. Which I think would be FlowBuilder the most sense for you guys.\nThem: Yeah. Thank you. Much appreciated to know who can we talk to here in Spain?\nMe: Yeah. Let me. Let me listen these. And again, like I mentioned, I'll give a couple specific examples there. Okay? Next steps. I have what we need to do the value estimations. I'll get back to you on those details. I James send over the training materials that we just discussed, and I'll also send over some intros onto who are the different. Here are a couple of solutions partners that I would recommend you work with. And then I realize. I can send them pings, but transparently, it's going to be the same form that you guys fill out if you were to send them a contact form here. But I'm also happy to play intermediary there, if that, as much as that's helpful. So just let me know on that front. And then getting you guys set up there, having you do the trial. And then I think what maybe makes sense is we should touch base around the end of the trial to like, hey, have you had a chance to get in? Have you connected to a solutions partner? Just answer any of those questions and then we can also maybe think about. Okay. Based off of this trial, based on what you've talked about, the solutions partner, which plan here may FlowBuilder sense as a starting point? Because just as a reminder, in case it I don't know if this came up last time, the way that our.\nThem: Okay?\nMe: The way that our pricing works for the teams planned is effectively based off of volume. So when you work with the solutions partner, they're going to help. They're going to help you understand, okay, how many tasks per month are we actually talking about in these systems? And that James tell us which plan here may FlowBuilder sense.\nThem: Okay, perfect.\nMe: Awesome. Cool. Those are sounds good. I'll send over the details on the trainings. Anything else? I guess maybe just like super tactically. Can we put on the calendar at the end of two weeks from now? To do the sort of trial check in.\nThem: Do you mind if we plan it for the week? I think I need to check my next travel.\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: But I James suggest. The last week of February. Because I'm on a travel quite a lot.\nMe: O. K that work? So we'll say I'll put the 24th, I'll put a counter on the 24th, but then just super tactically, then I would suggest not starting the trial until the week of the 9th, so that.\nThem: Okay?\nMe: You have. Because if you use it now and then we wait a month to talk again, there's probably lots.\nThem: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I'm gonna forget most of things. Yeah.\nMe: Exactly.\nThem: Yeah.\nMe: I'll send an email. I'll send the email now. We'll send the email on the 9th, but then I'll send another reminder that week just like, hey, You probably would. Start the trial, start reaching out to those solutions partners, and then we'll touch base. That last week of February.\nThem: Perfect. Thank you.\nMe: Okay, awesome. Great. I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you for taking the time. And I James talk.\nThem: Thank you very much, Alex.\nMe: Of course. Goodbye.\nThem: Thank you. See you. Bye.\n\n---\n\n**View in NoteFlow AI:** [https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/990a5bef-4850-4a46-a360-afe342a221ca](https://example.com/... AI.ai/d/990a5bef-4850-4a46-a360-afe342a221ca)\n",

To feel confident, doing a more full build. Like, how would you. How. What do you. Yeah. Like, if we say two weeks from now, what do you need to see to be like, okay, this makes sense.

Receiving. How we can manage AutomateFlow. What can we do with all the connections that do that you currently have that? We.

At the scale I think we're discussing in terms of year plan, most of those are going to be like self serve training options. So it's going to be like there's like workshops, there are like groups like in different companies that are available that people can join. There's like online courses that have like, build along elements that people can join, and then it would be sort of like on you guys to actually go do the connections. And I think Matteo, if I understand correctly, it sounds like would be the person doing the actual build. On your side. If I'm. If I'm right, correct about."

So we'll send you guys, like, some of the initial tours, and then I can also, there's, there's a couple of templates around sort of this, like, AI customer response piece in general that I can specifically send that I think would be a good, a good place to start. And so what I would propose probably super tactically is I'll send over some of those, like initial training materials. Would FlowBuilder sense for you guys to, like, then take that string materials, like, like, do the trial, try to connect stuff. And if you, if it gets to a point where you're like, hey, we need, we need to extend the trial slightly, that's something that we can do as well, but that's going to. Be the. I think the best path forward for you to, like, quickly, like, hey, let's get these connections run. I'll show you the template for the AI one. Let's. Let's get one connected and actually see what's going there. And then, you know, you're probably talking in the order of magnitude of like, one to two months of, like, build time. And this is with the caveat of, like, this, you know, assuming it's like you're starting from scratch, you still have to learn all the AutomateFlow stuff. It wouldn't. If for our people, this James probably take a couple weeks, but from starting, from scratch, you're probably talking four to six weeks of, like, development time to get to the pieces that you guys are talking about."

What I think may be helpful is we have third party consultants who can work with you. Like, so they're like, these are experts in AutomateFlow, who they work with a lot of our clients to, like, actually build some of these things. They'll, like, run trainings with you, and those are, I think, much more in line with, like, the value proposition that you guys are talking about. So I guess just for context, I was. I shared this with Javier yesterday. Our enterprise plans that had come with, like, AutomateFlow support building it for you start at around US$50-100K a year, with the average being around between 75. And 100,000. And so, based on our conversations yesterday, and also, honestly, just like the value estimate we just went through, right, because you're talking entire year, it's $20-50K of benefit. Even with cost savings, you're probably just not getting to enough of a value proposition for the like, higher enterprise. Plans to FlowBuilder sense. What I would then, given that AutomateFlow Solutions Partners and I'm just going to dare you to this list. There's just, there's a couple specific ones. Like actually, Flow Digital is one that I've worked with a bunch. They're based out of Australia. And actually, I think there might be. Let me check."

I've worked with Flow Digital, have not worked with some of these others, but they have all really great reviews. These would be. These would be the people who would like, hey, like, let's come build these. Let's do some, like, actual hands on training with our people, all that kind of jazz.

I'll get back to you on those details. I James send over the training materials that we just discussed, and I'll also send over some intros onto who are the different. Here are a couple of solutions partners that I would recommend you work with. And then I realize. I can send them pings, but transparently, it's going to be the same form that you guys fill out if you were to send them a contact form here. But I'm also happy to play intermediary there, if that, as much as that's helpful. So just let me know on that front. And then getting you guys set up there, having you do the trial. And then I think what maybe makes sense is we should touch base around the end of the trial to like, hey, have you had a chance to get in? Have you connected to a solutions partner? Just answer any of those questions and then we can also maybe think about. Okay. Based off of this trial, based on what you've talked about, the solutions partner, which plan here may FlowBuilder sense as a starting point? Because just as a reminder, in case it I don't know if this came up last time, the way that our."

      "rawText": "Meeting Title: AutomateFlow <> Coolrooms - Finance and Accounting Use Cases\nDate: Jan 19\nMeeting participants: Javier Raynaud, Matteo Secci\n\nTranscript:\n \nThem: Recording in progress.  \nMe: Hi, Javier. How are you doing?  \nThem: We just had hearing Spain a very big. How do you say, two trains that collide one with each other? Here.  \nMe: Crash.  \nThem: Yes. Huge crash with two trains. In the south of Spain, and we are a little bit in shock because there are so many people dead.  \nMe: Oh, no. Do you guys want to just give it a couple days?  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: Sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: Yes. We're going to have three days. That's what you said. Or what? Did you want to. Sorry.  \nMe: Oh, no, no. We can plan to meet later this week.  \nThem: No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. No, I mean, the crash was like, 300 kilometers away. We don't have any families are related, but it's just so shock to see. But no, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. We can go ahead for sure.  \nMe: A lot. I had not heard about that. I'm so sorry.  \nThem: No, no, no. It's been so recently. It's been now. I don't know, maybe six, seven hours ago.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: We are. We are all ready so we can start. Alex.  \nMe: Let me share my screen. I sent over last night some of the materials that I wanted to go through, but there's a couple of things I wanted to do with this time. One, just kind of get a sense of come of your guys'like biggest pains. Time sinks where you finding the most errors. What's the most annoying things that you do right now. Actually, on the finance team, I have a couple of examples that I've pulled from some real customers just to show, like, the types of things that we see some finance teams doing that can be successful. And then what I one thing I would actually really love to do is at least spend a little bit of time validating sort of the value assumptions. I know, like, Javier, when we spoke the first time, we were like, hey, whether or not an enterprise plan makes sense really comes down to sort of the value proposition that we're able to get. Like, how much are we saving, how much revenue? Impact are we getting? And so I want to have an initial conversation around what are some of the underlying assumptions that we can use to FlowBuilder those estimates?  \nThem: Sure.  \nMe: Those are kind of the three things I'm hoping to get out of this time. I know we have separate time with your other team members to actually kick off the trial around the automated responses, but I think for this group, that's. These three things are kind of the core focus. Anything else you want to FlowBuilder. Sure we get in this time or any other questions you specifically had that you feel feel like weren't answered from that.  \nThem: Oh, sorry. I didn't realize I didn't have my video, but there we go. Sorry.  \nMe: So this is a good sort of agenda for us today.  \nThem: Okay? Good. Yeah, we went through with Matteo. We check it earlier this morning.  \nMe: Yeah. Okay, great. So. Okay, cool. So it sounds like this is. I guess maybe then let's just start. If we start with some of the roi. If you guys. You said you took a look at it this morning, just like, one initial reaction. Is this, like, order of magnitude directionally? Correct. Are we, like, way off in. Terms of, like, the estimates, particularly around some of this, like, group bookings estimates that we're doing. That's one where I could see us potentially needing to have some refinements. Could. Yeah. Could you talk to me a bit about what your reactions were if you look through this?  \nThem: Just to. Well. I understood that this group booking, individual reservation. This is for. The. I mean, for the project that we are doing with. The truth is that Fernando, he's the one leading because he's in sales. Well, he's in sales and revenue. He's the head of revenue in the group. And he should be the one really validating those numbers. I don't want.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: To if it was something more related to the cost. Matteo and I, we definitely, we could. Say something. We have something to say. But as we are talking about revenue and he's the head. Of the company with the revenue. He's like,  \nMe: Like speak for like, for him out there.  \nThem: Exactly. Because maybe I'm saying, oh, I'm seeing this figure to be huge or too big or whatever, or I don't see. And he got maybe all the. We already find out with the different hotels. The information. I don't know if he sent it to you already.  \nMe: Oh, no, we haven't shared that with me. Yet.  \nThem: So he James send it to you tomorrow. In the interview, in the meeting that you have with him tomorrow. But. We got. Do you remember when I said, I think it would be a nice idea if we have. So we got those numbers because I've been copied in all those emails.  \nMe: Yeah. Great.  \nThem: So we have now something I would say exactly more realistic because it came from all the different head of the departments from front office and the people that are really there working and getting all these emails and everything. So I think those numbers tomorrow you would be able to see whether it is more or less corrected or not. And As I said, I think Fernando should be the person that validates you those numbers.  \nMe: To base that off. Y. Eah. That does FlowBuilder sense. And I realize it's a smaller amount, but I guess. Did you have it did on the. Cost side. Did that seem reasonable? Let me open up the actual detail here. So if we were looking at around some of these time savings that we had laid out around the use cases, AP invoice processing month end reconciliation. Expense report routing. Are some of these, like, order of magnitude? Did on the cost side that this feel. Reasonable and I can just to indicate how we like sort of on the back end how we're thinking about this just makes some assumptions around like people's hourly's rate, kind of how long complex simple tasks are. Again, these are like sort of peanut butter assumptions, but just to sort of get a back of the envelope. Estimate here. And then estimated, like, cost of, like, a data breach or something like that, which I think for actually, you guys, this is actually potentially lower for you than it would be for some of our other clients, because you're not necessarily keeping, like, detailed customer personal information that you have on side, but that is what informs these numbers. I'll share this again afterwards, but feel free to, like, play with the assumptions in here, because I want to get to a point where you guys can, like, believe that, you know, these numbers that we're estimating are at least reasonable again. It can always change. But when I understand if they're released in the right direction.  \nThem: Okay? Okay?  \nMe: Okay? And then I guess just one last question on this. Not necessarily. Is this a right amount? Could you let me know, like, how does this compare to, like, your, your FY25 revenue targets? Is this saying like a 10% over what you're currently revenue targets are? Is this like 5% over what your current revenue targets are for the year, just sort of like order of magnitude that we're talking about.  \nThem: But are we talking of all our hotels?  \nMe: Yeah, I would say. I would say. I would say for the, like, for the year, across all your hotels.  \nThem: Or just. Would be 12. Well, that could be around a 3%.  \nMe: Okay? That's helpful context, because I definitely James review that with Rafael tomorrow. But at least 3%. Like, it tells me I'm not. I'm not claiming, oh, we'll get 50% revenue increases, right? Like, 3% at least to me. Like, I'm not. Not insane level to, like, benchmark around. Helpful. Okay, thank you. And I James review those more in depth with Rabio in tomorrow. Okay?  \nThem: Sure.  \nMe: Let's talk a bit about what are some of the, like, use things that you guys spend the most time on today? Like I mentioned, I, I have a couple of examples of other use cases, but could you sort of walk me through, you know, in an average week, like, what are the two or three things that are like, most annoying to you right now?  \nThem: I'm sure Matteo James be able to help you with that. He's doing the daily basis. Task work. I would just quickly go ahead, and then he James. He James tell us.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: From my experience. We have a lot of invoice recording invoices manually. Which I think that's one of the cases that you put here to this AP invoices.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: This one, Alex is very. Useful and very interesting. But the thing is that we are changing. We are in the process of changing our ERP. Our accounting system. And apparently the one that we are upgrading, it's going to allow us to register those invoices, just get the PDF and then it James record automatically into the system with the AI and everything.  \nMe: Yeah. Could you that you guys are.  \nThem: So if. Sorry.  \nMe: What system? You said you're starting a new one. Sage.  \nThem: Sage. Yeah, it's sage 200.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And then sage200 had one of the different.  \nMe: Like add ons or modules or something like.  \nThem: Model. Thank you. That was where I was looking for one of the models. Now it's going to allow us to register the invoice. And the purchase order. Both of them automatically. Which is going to save us a hell of amount of time. So this is going to be if this is true. I mean, we have already watch and seems to be right because we already have some test and some trials. And seems to be fine. If finally it is not as we really want to. That would be something that definitely we need to work for us. It's one of the main reasons why we switch. To sage 200. It's because of this invoice recording automatically, so this is going to save us a lot of time.  \nMe: Maybe follow up question there. Could you talk to me a bit about. Okay, it sounds like once it's in Sage, Sage can like take this PDF, do the processing. Where does that PDF come from? Is it like an email that, like, someone sends you? Is it like. Go ahead.  \nThem: Most of our invoices comes from. Emails from emails. So it James comes from emails or we can just take a picture or whatever. If it's a piece of paper, if it's a receipt or whatever, just taking a picture. We can get this into the system and they James also register. So seems to be quite. Good, or at least they made a try with us, and we saw that it's going to work with PDF. It's going to work with just a simple picture taken with our phones. So seems to be. That's what we saw. Quite convenient.  \nMe: Okay, awesome. And then maybe there's like places around there where, you know, you might want to connect Sage back to your CRM and update potentially. Or say, tying activities and Sage to reporting. That might be a place where AutomateFlow could be helpful. But it seems like this invoice piece, at least for now, is a solid for you guys within.  \nThem: Sure. We have also. Well, Matteo James give you a little bit more details. We have something that is the second thing we're going to talk to now. We call it petty cash. I think you have it also there recording the expenses. There is something in the next. In the next slide.  \nMe: Yeah, yeah. That was when.  \nThem: Exactly. I think that's the expense receipt forward. If we have lots of not really invoices, but receipt without VAT and everything. And we have to record that manually. It's kind of. It looks like an invoice, the process, more or less. It's the same that we do with an invoice, but we do not record the vat. So it's very heavy work. Nonsense. Work that we have to do very manually. And that was one of the things Matteo and I, we were wondering. That maybe here you can. Yes. Help us and come here and give us. We start to think how could we just change it. I James let Matteo tell you what we thought.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And we give you a little bit of insight of what we thought and maybe from what we do.  \nMe: Tell me. About it.  \nThem: We are considering Pettycash reference system. So it's playing you how it work? Each receptionist as his own cash box. And the rhythm month. They spend the money as they need. It. And the last day of each month, they print on a table. Like an excel. With a year operation and then they included their receipt or invoice. Payback to get paid back. We can process the reimbursement. So we want to.  \nMe: Like we fill their cash is by, like, proving that they've gotten the. That they've been spending it on the appropriate things.  \nThem: Exactly. Sorry. They have, let's say, 800 in their box. So they're expending every day. Today 550, tomorrow 150, and they are collecting the tickets. Okay, we gather all those tickets. And then they need to give us those tickets in order to get back their money we give them. We reimburse them so that they get already their cash back again. With those tickets. What we do is that we register in the systems and then we do the accounting process. But this is all very manual. What we would like to have is to begin with, to have a paper less so. We would like to avoid all the papers. I would like them. We would like them to do some kind of photos or scan everything. And then we would like to have this information that they James have. Somehow they need to post it.  \nMe: Down.  \nThem: Instead of having in a piece of paper and attached as they have it already. We can set something that Matteo thought today. I think he is going to show you now. It could be quite useful. Some kind of information where you can attach your PDF or your picture or whatever. And the final income that we would like to have is just an Excel with all the information. Okay. So that we can then post into the system. If AutomateFlow can also FlowBuilder us go this directly to sage 200, that would be lovely. So you know that instead of if we have already all the information from all the different persons.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Summarize to be able to do the posting just in once for us. Wonderful. If we can go one step further and that Excel be able to translate in an XML file just to go to Sage and post it automatically, that would be like a really wonderful. But that would be our thoughts how we could.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. Could you. A couple. Just a couple questions to sort of get a. Get my arms around this one. How many? Well, I guess one is it. One for each. It'd be like one account for each hotel, I assume. How many? But, like, each receptionist would need to handle it. Themselves, or is there, like, a single manager at the hotel who has sort of authority to use this fund?  \nThem: Be interception each reception. Yeah, they have custom box and then they spend the money and the last day of them on the prepare table to resume their expense. And. Manager. Their manager can approve the expensive or no. That's something very important that Matteo just said and we forgot in the meantime, this process, when they are posting it, this would need to go to their managers to approve those expenses before it get back to us.  \nMe: Got. Cha.  \nThem: That's very important. Something that I wanted just to point out. In Seville, in a hotel that we have in Seville, every single receptionist, which are more or less six, not five, six receptionist. They James need to be able to work with that in the other hotels. There is only one box, one cash. There's only one cash. So it's only one person. Maybe it could be different persons, but it would be only. As you said. I mean, in the other hotels, we only have one cash.  \nMe: Who likes the authority to, like, actually spend the money in this account.  \nThem: Exactly. It would be only one account, really, in the other hotels.  \nMe: And I guess follow up question there is that is that a function of the sort of manual process today, or would you want to give the receptionist the ability to spend? Or is it like we prefer the managers do it in sort of in an ideal world.  \nThem: No, no, they can do it. But the receptionist can spend the money. But it has to then go to the approval of the manager, of the manager, of the AFO manager. If the airfo manager is not happy or has any other questions, would go to the receptionist and I would ask why did you spend that? Or why? I mean, he would ask the questions, but usually if they spend the money is because the client is asking for.  \nMe: Gotcha. Yeah.  \nThem: They. They do it. They do it. They don't need to ask. Every single time they spend something, they don't go to the managers and said, hey, So that's why maybe one authorization per month. Maybe we don't need to have to to have it. Every single time there is one. Every time they post something into whatever system we create. Maybe they can all go by the Nth Mound. And at the month end, the manager goes and checks all of them and said, okay, they're all fine.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Or something like that, I don't know.  \nMe: I mean, I. I think we can definitely work through the specific design. I think it'll come down to, like, doing some. Spending some time with your manager, spending some time with some of the, some of the receptionists to say, like, what is your actual process flow? How, like what, like, should you take a picture and, like, email it. Do we want to have a form that you guys consistently fill out? But the overall structure here is something we see a lot of customers doing variations of, where it's like, hey, we have these, like, receipts that we need reviewed. We want each of those receipts to be processed. And then, you know, whatever cadence we decide there's a manager who goes, reviews them, and assuming those are all good, they're fine. But then there are exceptions, you know, that gets raised to you guys so you can have proactive visibility that something like, might be off. And in a potential ideal world, Right. If these are happening sort of automatically, maybe you get notified halfway through the month that there's an anomaly that you need to look into without having to wait until the end, but still having it be a relatively lightweight process for everyone. This. This one makes. This one makes a ton of sense. And I think that's. This is a use case we can work towards building for you guys. Talk to me. Is there any other piece of this puzzle? If we think about, like, hey, what does this state today? What is sort of your ideal future state? What does it take to get there? I feel like we have all of the pieces here. Anything, any. Anything else that I'm missing? If I were going to go to, like, you know, talk to one of our solutions architects about how to build this out. Anything else we need to know?  \nThem: Much do you think of anything? I don't know. I mean, Matteo showed me an idea this morning, and maybe. Maybe Matteo can show you. Yeah, we want to collect all transaction detail through Microsoft form. We work. Yeah, we were thinking about Microsoft form and then. Wait just a minute. How can I. We would like. We would like to do it.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: As simple as possible for the receptionist. So it could be either what Matteo is going to show you, or it could be just an Excel template.  \nMe: Y. Eah.  \nThem: If we can give them to the employees, just an Excel template where they just can need to fill in. The information that we need. I'm sharing the screen. Can you see?  \nMe: I am. I can see.  \nThem: Yeah. So that's the name.  \nMe: That. Yep.  \nThem: Surname, the month. Just a minute. Yeah. So the name, the month. So just. We can.  \nMe: Sorry. Is that which property?  \nThem: No, no. He just created just like they.  \nMe: What is what? Is. I apologize. What is ape dos? Oh, surname.  \nThem: Name, surname?  \nMe: Okay? Sorry.  \nThem: Month. So they choose the month. So. And then they choose the type. Expense. So it's leverage or food. Flower store. Flowers for the room. For the room. Yeah. So they put here flowers.  \nMe: Any, like, description of? Yeah.  \nThem: Some few flowers. Flowers for exactly. And then they choose if they fits an invoice or just an invoice or just a ticket. So in boys, put the number of them voice so number. 12, so. And then now they can upload the invoice.  \nMe: Yep. Or if it's a receipt, upload the receipt.  \nThem: Already received. So just a random picture.  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. And then 10 years.  \nMe: Yeah, okay.  \nThem: Okay? Did you finish it with petty cash?  \nMe: Okay, so, like, it's probably responsibly because they need.  \nThem: Yeah. No. And another one. Yeah. And we want to collect all this information. To improve our peticash system. So that we have today. Today we, as I said, we have it very basic. We have just an Excel, the white axle, where they put, okay, flowers, root €10. Then food. We went to the supermarket and we bought mayonnaise for the restaurant. And so we have this whole list with. Bunch, and then most of the receipts attached and we stapled. And then so we have the physical paper with the physical tickets and everything that comes for every single transaction. For every single reception, every single receptionist. So we have, like, a bunch of things that we have to go and process every day. Every period, month end. Okay?  \nMe: Y. O talk to me a bit about, does that impact your, like, audits at all? I feel like that must be, like, a nightmare when you're, like, doing audits at the end of the year and things like that.  \nThem: Well, we. We. Get. We don't have an audit that is asking us for all those little details. We are not. We are not such a big. We are deluxe, you know. We are five star deluxe hotels. We are deluxe company.  \nMe: Okay? Okay? Yeah.  \nThem: But our hotels are small boutiques. So we are having 50 rooms so we don't get this amount of revenue that we force us to have. I used to work for Marriott, so I know what kind of audits you are talking about.  \nMe: Yeah, that's not something you guys have to worry about.  \nThem: Exactly. So with Marriott we have this. Of course, this Deloitte, you know, that comes every year and asks you about everything and we are not so big.  \nMe: Gotcha.  \nThem: As a company and as a hotel. So we don't have this type of audience. But of course, we need to have everything square and round, well organized. But as we said, we definitely want to improve this process. It could be either what Matteo showed you, so these kind of template, or any kind of template that then goes to the manager, the call to the manager, to the authorization, and then it gets back to us.  \nMe: For sure. Yeah.  \nThem: As a nice exhale, where we have. Where we have all those information that they have recorded, or it can be just one template that we can give them.  \nMe: The report that you can have that.  \nThem: And then just fill like what they are doing right now today.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: That they are. They have a wide axle and they fill it in. Excel themselves, but once they fill this, we want to have the rest, the rest of the process working automatically. We want to.  \nMe: Versus having a manager review it, Versus having you and Matteo review it. Like it's. It's a lot of time for you. The hotel manager today.  \nThem: Exactly.  \nMe: How can we streamline that and the example you just showed, like, that form we can 100% use. Honestly, we could use that exact form, right? Connect. Connect that form, have the AutomateFlow automation trigger as a new entry comes to that form. If you're like, we would rather, you know, actually, we're. Working, we decided we want to use Google form instead. We have sort of like flexibility to any of those systems that you use if you later switch out and you're like, hey, we have a new system where the receptionist at the front desk, or we have like a new CRM or hotel management system that we're incorporating and we want them to do, do that. There's lots of flexibility on what those pieces are. So all that, to say what you've described, we definitely can do. We can build it off of Matteo that, like, example that you started. We can just continue building off that so that actually going forward doesn't change at all for the receptionist once if you're able to implement something on the back end, okay. That's super helpful. The other use case I wanted to raise. Actually, not this one. The bookings to invoice automation. I was curious if this is something that comes up for you guys, like, if you have those group bookings, like, how are you getting those invoices to customers for, like, larger.  \nThem: We have them out. We have them now. That's something that we discussed this morning with Matteo. This is not applying to us, really. For example, booking. But we have an Internet with booking where we check every single. Reservations, we check every single. We check that all the customers that they are supposed to come, they arrived through the. Intranet with booking, for example, our Expedia, which is an American one.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Through the Expedia intranet. We checked that everything is fine and they send us directly this invoice.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: We have a direct debit to the bank. This comes from email. That this comes. This invoice comes in an email with a PDF. With this new sage 200 we are supposed to get now this PDF into the system and it James be automatically post.  \nMe: Great. Sorry, one follow up question. How is it? Is Sage automatically picking up those emails? So like there's an inbox the emails James land. That might one just. That might be one piece of this where like AutomateFlow can help. Where it's like, hey, the email drops, just upload to Sage without someone having to respond, but it sounds like the most of this process today is like, pretty good as is. Okay? And then this is another one that we often see. Finance teams using just in terms of like cash position management. Just curious, is this something that you've seen is relevant for you guys? Is it something that you are thinking about day to day or is it not as much of an issue, particularly when you're dealing with the petty cash? I could see that sort of replacing a need for something like this.  \nThem: What do you exactly means by the daily cash position? Tell me exactly is it? Review there the cash of the transaction.  \nMe: Well, the cash of the transaction, and I think part of it is, is meant to just FlowBuilder it very easy to have day to day cash flow estimates. So, like, it could be.  \nThem: So it's. It's a cash flow. No, it's a cash flow position. What you're.  \nMe: Y. Es.  \nThem: Okay? The truth is that we don't have. We have. Someone in our headquarter. She? Checks our bank's account. And she knows where are most of our payments. And we do. We do cash flows that we handed to her. So that she knows what are the main payments. That we are going to have and she checks. But that's something that I James definitely would like to have a little bit more automatic. To have some kind of automation.  \nMe: Maybe that's a conversation we have with her around, like, hey, how do we set this up so that you're, like. The parts of this that are, like, tedious are taken care of. And it's just the ones where, like, oh, we actually need human engagement on this, because I imagine most of them are. Probably really straightforward, but every once in a while you hit something where like, oh, I actually need someone who understands our business to understand the context to take a look here.  \nThem: In this case, Alex, I want to wait until we get this sage 200 because I know there is also one of this module, one of the that says that they work with these cash flows. So I want to see exactly what this cash flow. Is talking about. So I want to have an idea how useful. Could be this for us. And then we can definitely. If it's not something that I'm trying to, we can definitely go on. And have a look with you. I mean, for us, what is very, very useful. Alex is that we already have your contact. That we know you're there.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And I think what we were thinking is, Think of something very specific, as you have now with Fernando for the emails to, you know.  \nMe: Y. Eah, responding to like.  \nThem: Exact exactly or what we just said with the petty cash with you. Matteo and I, we are going to start thinking about really specific cases that we can go with you and say, hey, Alex, we have here another specific with our day to day.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: How can we go and how can we. And I think. It won't be in a very long future time. We would be contacting you regarding hr. We want to because we want to be really clear. We are with the HR manager of the company. We are trying to get. A procedure for all different hotels and have one main procedure. Once we have cleared the procedure, we are going to see how we can automatic. Sorry with this word.  \nMe: Es. I guess one thing I might offer we often see that we have a lot of customers who run their hr, or not run completely, but like use AutomateFlow for a lot of those different HR pieces. It may be helpful to do like. I don't know if a workshop is the right word with one of our solutions architects and you guys and the HR person to say, like, hey, this is sort of like what we view as like a best in practice. If you're using AutomateFlow for hr, like, here's how you can FlowBuilder sure that the people who are applying are real people. Here's how you can FlowBuilder the onboarding process as seamless as possible. Here's how you can FlowBuilder sure attrition is as low as possible. Like, we have a couple of like of those high level things that I think can help inform how you structure and design the new world, if that would FlowBuilder sense.  \nThem: Good. Sure, sure. For us. It would be great if we can. You can show us. Because this James as we are building up the structure, if we can. Say for sure.  \nMe: So let me follow up, ping you right after this. If you can find a time that would work for. If it's you, me and the HR person. It was just me and the HR person. Whatever. Kind of makes sense. And what I'll do is we have someone on our side who formally worked in our hr. Team, but now spends her time working with companies and, like, this is how we've done what sort of best in class looks like. So I'll bring her to that conversation to, like, give you guys a really clear example of, like, here's best in practice on some of those HR things.  \nThem: That's what we really would be good for us, is to have, like, a specific example, like the one that you did now here in your presentation that you give us us specific as you can give us. It help us to see whether it fit us in our way of working, in our way of doing things.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So. Yes, for sure. But. But as I said, I think we should go. And carry on with this petty cash, which is something that I think we could.  \nMe: Yes, we can start. We can get started on building that.  \nThem: Exactly.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And then we can see. Mateo and I, we see something else. That can happen. I mean, that we feel that you can help us to counter, to say, hey, Alex, we've got something else. What do you think? And then you give us your insight.  \nMe: Y. Eah. That sounds. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: And. And then, I mean, in parallel. We can go and see this HR So we can see if we. If you give us a nice specific examples of things, that it could also fit us in our way of doing things.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Well.  \nMe: That I 100% do. I guess the only question I have in terms from the HR piece in parallel, is there any sort of, like, existing document that can help? Just help me prepare for that conversation. Okay. If not, but if you have any, like, process stocks that you've started, any meeting recordings that I can review, on those that would be helpful in that context.  \nThem: But this. As I said, we are Finance and that's hr. It's like with Fernando. We don't want to mix, you know, in there, in there. Put, you know, our legs in their departments, they decide how. That's why tomorrow, even though we are in the meeting.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: We are invited, but I think you would be doing it with a Fernando. With Fernando and Salom. Okay, we won't be, because we were very interested on having you, you know, as a country, as a contract so that we can go and we start doing, you know.  \nMe: That makes sense. Talk the finance. Stuff.  \nThem: The things that really help us in our department. So for tomorrow, I don't think Matteo and I would be in this. Okay. In this meeting. But we James have, you know, the ones here with the finance and probably because we are more in contact with HR than we are with. The revenue.  \nMe: That makes sense. What? The revenue side. So let's get together next week. I'll bring a solutions architect. We can actually start like connecting for this petty cash workflow. Start like building this out what this looks like. Do you want to do maybe next Wednesday for us to get together? And, like, actually start, like, building out that workflow in depth, like, start connecting some data sources, like, all that kind of stuff.  \nThem: Okay, let me see Matteo. You can. Okay. Yeah.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Let me see. Next first day. Well, maybe I would be traveling, but I don't still. I still don't know. But it's okay for me.  \nMe: Honestly, if I understand correctly, this might just be a better use of time with Mateo. Honestly, because, like, with. If we're thinking with the solutions architects, like, they're going to be getting into, like, the technical details of, like, what systems do we connect? Like, how do we actually.  \nThem: For sure. And he's the one that has all the knowledge. So if I'm there, perfect. If I cannot be there, Matteo is the person that you would need.  \nMe: Okay? That sounds good. I guess the only. The only other question I have for you, Javier, is how are you thinking about, like, the timing of the license? So, like you mentioned, right, we're going to be. We're going to start working with Raphael, like, tomorrow. They're going to try sort of a pilot with some. Of these initial use cases. RSA James likely help them build that out. We're going to help you build some of these out. Are you guys imagining, like, towards the end of this month that you're actually, like, starting the contract and then we're, like, building for you? Are you aiming, like, for later to. Actually have, you know, AutomateFlow running in your systems?  \nThem: Sorry. Could you repeat it again? Because I lost the last sentence that.  \nMe: No worries. Just. Just kind of. What timeline are you guys thinking about wanting to do a contract? Because you mentioned. Hey, we'll start a contract. With Raphael's team. Phil, we'll build this out. Maybe then we'll. We'll build out some of the finance cases. Sorry. Yeah.  \nThem: Sure. Well, Alex. I mean, to me, it depends. As you would say. I mean, money talks. So we need to know, what kind of solution are we going to get versus how much is going to cost us?  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: So we need to have this idea before, you know, we definitely want to improve things, but things, they have to be.  \nMe: Cost effective. It makes sense. Return. A reasonable return on investment for what you guys are getting.  \nThem: Exactly. So in order to know if we would like to have it as soon as possible. But I mean. I mean, as soon as possible. We are not in a hurry because.  \nMe: Okay? It's not like losing money necessarily, like, every day, like, you're. You're not in season yet in terms of, like, lead leads, outreach and stuff like that that aren't coming.  \nThem: No at all.  \nMe: Things like that.  \nThem: No. No, no, no, not at all. Not at all. Especially in our. In our. Department. Okay? We are. We can save time and time. We know that at the end it's money. Or we can save time to do better things, Other things. But that we have it clear. But we want. We need to know the cost of the investment.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Because then we need to rise up, and then we need to see if we get the green light or not. I mean, it's not something that we can just on our, you know, on our own, decide, okay? We go ahead or not.  \nMe: Could you talk to me a bit about? When you say rise up, like, who are the other people that would need to give input?  \nThem: Whether the general manager.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: The general manager of the company. We have to give them because depending on the cost of the investment, we need to know because we already have all our 2026 budgets approved. So we need to ask for a special request.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: If we want to have it. If we want to have it by 26.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: Another option is okay, we know how much it cost. We like it. But it's going to be on the project of 27. Because we approved by August. August, September. We approve all the expenses for next year.  \nMe: Got. Cha okay?  \nThem: So that, that's, that's why depending on what kind of investment we are talking about, we can have it done this year. It James need to wait to be approved for 27. Or we can have a special, you know, approval, and then we can get done it now in 2026.  \nMe: That means. That makes a ton of sense. Okay, this is helpful, and I apologize, but this is just. This is just helping me think about, like, what. What offer to put together for you guys that, like, could actually be, like, reasonable, right? Is have what types of things have gotten that. Except if you're like, hey, you have, you know, you have your 26 budget. Have you in the past gotten exceptions for software purchases? And what types of arguments are you guys making or what types of, like, level of value proposition are you talking about before that's something that the general manager starts to consider.  \nThem: Well, it depends. For example. For this, sage.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: I mean, it was somewhere in between because we were very close to next year approval. But if the general manager considers that there is very interesting that we are saving. We are the ones that we need to convince the general manager to approve it. So I need to be convinced once. Once I'm convinced.  \nMe: Yeah. Yeah.  \nThem: Exactly. You know, I can do my work, but then I have to. I have to sit reasonable. Once I get. Your Once I get your exactly your budget, I James know if it's something that I can fight for 2026. I know if it's something that James need to wait 20, 27 or, or I need to. So it James really depend on what we are talking about that I know if I can do it via express, via normal procedure or via, you know, exception.  \nMe: Gotcha. Okay? Okay? That doesn't FlowBuilder. That does FlowBuilder sense. I'll put together some detailed proposals for you. A kind of like what are sort of like services offering or prices look like at different levels kind of. And it's really driven off of a couple of things. One how many tasks you use. Like how. Like how much volume is actually going through the system. Two. What is the training from us? Oh, wait. Sorry. Yeah. There we go. The learning. I lost my train of thought. The number of tasks you use, the training and support you get from us, and the governance and security features that you guys would have access to in the account. Sort of like allowing people in HR to have certain apps available to them. But like, for example, Matteo wouldn't be able to connect to the HR apps like some of those types of security concerns. Generally, there's broad magnitudes, but I just want to give you, like, an order of magnitude so you can have a sense of where we're, what we're talking about. Most of our enterprise plans start at around US$50-100K a year, with the average being between 75,000 and 100,000. US dollars. And so I think it comes back to, like, those value estimates that we were talking about. Like, hey, if we can really show 300k of, like, potential improvement, then maybe a 50k investment makes sense. But if that's not realistic, then it becomes not potentially reasonable to discuss.  \nThem: Okay? And are we talking? Recurrent fee. So that we are talking this is yearly or.  \nMe: That is. That is yearly. That's correct. And the big thing that I think makes that, potentially, that makes that worthwhile is that we're helping you look through. Okay, what are the next set of use cases? So this sort of exercise we just went through, where you're like, hey, like, these are two that. Are useful. Here's an HR one that might be useful. Here's another one for people on our team that might be useful. And then we can actually go build those for you. And so it raises the ceiling a lot on what the value proposition is. Because, of course, like, as we're doing, this evaluation James want to come up with a set of, like, specific use cases that are valuable for you guys. The jobs of our technical account managers and our sort of AI automation strategist team that you get is to help you guys think of, like, what are those next things? What are like the fourth, fifth use cases that we want to use, and how do we actually embed that across the business? And so that's the kind of value that we're seeing on the enterprise plan. But like I mentioned, I think it comes back to, hey, are we even in the right ballpark in terms of the impact on the business that we're expecting to drive?  \nThem: Okay? Understood?  \nMe: I guess reactions to that is that. Does that feel in the realm of possibility? Is that like, hey, this is an order of magnitude off from where we could even consider. Is it like, it's possible, but it's going to be hard, and so we have to FlowBuilder a strong case. Like, talk to me a bit. About kind of your initial reactions.  \nThem: Well, the thing that we are going to have. This charge, it's going to be every single year.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: For the kind of company that we are. So far, I'm not telling you if we have a 15 or 20 hotels. Then I would say that maybe. I mean, I wouldn't see a problem. But so far, I mean, we have to FlowBuilder an investment of 15,000, 20,000 or whatever. Thousand, if it's something that really help us, could be feasible.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But having that charge. Recurring. Seems to me. A bit high having that every year for. The kind of things that we are talking about right now, which is something that James help us, but the petty cash is something that.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: It. 's a small task.  \nMe: Eah. Like that. Like that.  \nThem: It's a very small task.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Exactly so to me. As you said, the first insight of the first would be that it's expensive for us. To have that recurring expense for, I mean. For this task or one or two, three tasks. Knowing what are our budgets, because the type of expenses that we already have.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Just with this sage that we are just now, we are making a very, very big investment.  \nMe: Investment.  \nThem: With this sage 200 and we are having this recurring expense. Well. But hopefully we are going to get a lot of things. That's the main thing. That's why we want. Because we are going to have these invoices done.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Well, it's going to be done automatically. We are going to have maybe this cash flow, this purchase order. So we are going to save. Lot of timing. And that's why we counted you. We want to keep this. We want to keep.  \nMe: Money.  \nThem: Improving. But as I said, we need to see what we are talking about. At the end of the day, we are the type of company that we are. We are definitely growing. Slowly but surely. We are not very aggressive, but we are improving. But we need to find it reasonable within our budgets. And so that's why it's very important that we know what we are talking about.  \nMe: What you're getting at. Yeah, okay.  \nThem: Exactly.  \nMe: That's helpful context. So like it. Like, your initial reaction is like, hey, that's a lot for us. It's more than we've spent on other types of software tools in the past and potentially more than what we've seen get exceptions in our budget for going forward. That makes a ton of sense. My initial reaction then is it probably is going to be a lot driven off of the conversation I have tomorrow with the revenue team, because if they think that there's real upside and value proposition there, it could, it could FlowBuilder sense. And then we can find additional use cases in hr, find additional use cases in the finance team. There's probably operations, things that, like, could FlowBuilder this, could FlowBuilder this more justified across the business. But it could turn out, it's like, hey, it actually just, we can't find enough value proposition here to FlowBuilder an enterprise partnership FlowBuilder sense. And what we want to do is have a couple of point solutions, and maybe what we do is like, hey, we spend some time getting Matteo trained and onboarded really strongly, and then so he can go and build these things for you guys in the system. That might be the approach that we end up going down.  \nThem: That would be also a solution. Maybe we can get someone trained like Matteo, that he. Well, he gets on well with all those softwares and all those. So. Well, we'll see how we can get. How we can get the best solution for all of us.  \nMe: Okay, awesome. That sounds great. I'll send over. So, super. Next steps we have. I have the call tomorrow with Ravel and his team James validate some of the assumptions there. Matteo we had agreed on. I think it was the 28th. I James send over an invite for the 28th where we can actually work through an. Example here in detail. Actually, I try to get some of this stuff connected so you can see what that petty cash flow looks like. And then I'll include this in the email. But then the next step James be potentially getting some HR use cases. Mapped out as well. Sounds good. Thanks guys. I appreciate the time, all the feedback and engagement. I look forward to work together, have rate.  \nThem: Good. Okay, thank you.  \nMe: Bye.  \nThem: Have a nice day. Bye. ",

Actually, on the finance team, I have a couple of examples that I've pulled from some real customers just to show, like, the types of things that we see some finance teams doing that can be successful. And then what I one thing I would actually really love to do is at least spend a little bit of time validating sort of the value assumptions. I know, like, Javier, when we spoke the first time, we were like, hey, whether or not an enterprise plan makes sense really comes down to sort of the value proposition that we're able to get.

Expense report routing. Are some of these, like, order of magnitude? Did on the cost side that this feel. Reasonable and I can just to indicate how we like sort of on the back end how we're thinking about this just makes some assumptions around like people's hourly's rate, kind of how long complex simple tasks are. Again, these are like sort of peanut butter assumptions, but just to sort of get a back of the envelope. Estimate here. And then estimated, like, cost of, like, a data breach or something like that, which I think for actually, you guys, this is actually potentially lower for you than it would be for some of our other clients, because you're not necessarily keeping, like, detailed customer personal information that you have on side, but that is what informs these numbers. I'll share this again afterwards, but feel free to, like, play with the assumptions in here, because I want to get to a point where you guys can, like, believe that, you know, these numbers that we're estimating are at least reasonable again.

Like how much volume is actually going through the system. Two. What is the training from us? Oh, wait. Sorry. Yeah. There we go. The learning. I lost my train of thought. The number of tasks you use, the training and support you get from us, and the governance and security features that you guys would have access to in the account. Sort of like allowing people in HR to have certain apps available to them. But like, for example, Matteo wouldn't be able to connect to the HR apps like some of those types of security concerns. Generally, there's broad magnitudes, but I just want to give you, like, an order of magnitude so you can have a sense of where we're, what we're talking about. Most of our enterprise plans start at around US$50-100K a year, with the average being between 75,000 and 100,000. US dollars. And so I think it comes back to, like, those value estimates that we were talking about. Like, hey, if we can really show 300k of, like, potential improvement, then maybe a 50k investment makes sense. But if that's not realistic, then it becomes not potentially reasonable to discuss."

Here's another one for people on our team that might be useful. And then we can actually go build those for you. And so it raises the ceiling a lot on what the value proposition is. Because, of course, like, as we're doing, this evaluation James want to come up with a set of, like, specific use cases that are valuable for you guys. The jobs of our technical account managers and our sort of AI automation strategist team that you get is to help you guys think of, like, what are those next things? What are like the fourth, fifth use cases that we want to use, and how do we actually embed that across the business? And so that's the kind of value that we're seeing on the enterprise plan.

My initial reaction then is it probably is going to be a lot driven off of the conversation I have tomorrow with the revenue team, because if they think that there's real upside and value proposition there, it could, it could FlowBuilder sense. And then we can find additional use cases in hr, find additional use cases in the finance team. There's probably operations, things that, like, could FlowBuilder this, could FlowBuilder this more justified across the business. But it could turn out, it's like, hey, it actually just, we can't find enough value proposition here to FlowBuilder an enterprise partnership FlowBuilder sense. And what we want to do is have a couple of point solutions, and maybe what we do is like, hey, we spend some time getting Matteo trained and onboarded really strongly, and then so he can go and build these things for you guys in the system.

Actually, I try to get some of this stuff connected so you can see what that petty cash flow looks like. And then I'll include this in the email.

Good morning. How are you guys doing? Well, I guess. Good afternoon for you guys. How are you?  \nThem: Hello, Alex. How are you doing?  \nMe: I'm doing great. Well. Javier is correct.  \nThem: He should be joining already. Yes.  \nMe: Oh, sorry. I apologize. What was your name?  \nThem: Fernando.  \nMe: Fernando. Okay? Great to meet you.  \nThem: Yeah. His name.  \nMe: What was your name, sir, with the glasses?  \nThem: My name is Fernando. He's Salomao. My name is Salomao I'm connected. Yes, it's my computer, which is connected at this meeting, but we are. At the same location.  \nMe: Nice. Great to meet you. Then we'll give Fernando just a moment to join as well.  \nThem: Yeah. Javier and Mateo should be joining in a minute.  \nMe: Okay, cool. You guys having a good week so far?  \nThem: Yes. Yes, because we are very close to two holidays.  \nMe: Yeah. Christmas soon.  \nThem: So just waiting a couple of days.  \nMe: I also realized my camera wasn't on just now.  \nThem: So yeah. It's. Okay? Are you getting holidays in Christmas?  \nMe: Yeah, I'm very excited. I'm spending going to visit my mom and sister for the holidays, which is very, very exciting.  \nThem: Yeah. Are you based in Chicago?  \nMe: I'm actually based out of Austin, Texas. It's still the same time zone at Chicago, but I'll be in Texas.  \nThem: Beautiful city.  \nMe: Yeah. Very, very you guys.  \nThem: I was. Yeah.  \nMe: So actually, I lived in Spain for a couple years and I was like a toddler. I don't remember at all. My dad was. We lived in Rota for two years and then we went to Madrid a couple times, theoretically. But I, of course, am too young to remember any of that.  \nThem: Y. Eah. Hello, mateo. How you doing? Hello. Is Javier joining the meeting as well? Yeah, I think. Yeah.  \nMe: He's coming on. He just joined the room.  \nThem: So. Rry. H. I. Javier. Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm a bit late.  \nMe: No worries. Thanks for taking the time. It looks like we have the whole crew here. So let's go ahead and get kicked off. I know you guys reached out to Varun. Initially, you'd asked basically just about what some of our enterprise features are. What about our enterprise plans? We'd love just to. Maybe you may have already gone through this with runes. I apologize. If so, maybe if you could just give me like a bit of context of like, what high level are you trying to solve for? Like, is it like a specific use case? Automation across the company, more broadly, AI transformation? Like, what are, what is it you're trying to drive for? And then get an understanding of. Okay, what AutomateFlow features may or may not be helpful in those contexts.  \nThem: Okay, well, the first thing that we would like to work in is automation of the emails that we receive at halt 11, because the number of emails every day is big, huge. This is for quality rooms, meeting rooms, group bookings, hotel information, et cetera, et cetera. So I think that that's something quite easy to automate.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: By following some rules or whatever, or getting the content information from the hotels directly from our chatbot, which is integrated in our booking engine. So I don't know. I believe that we have several ways of automating these processes.  \nMe: Could you?  \nThem: This is one of the ideas that we would like to start with.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. Could you talk to me about a bit about what systems do you guys use today? Are you like a Gmail Outlook shop? What is the integration engine that you guys use?  \nThem: Yeah. We are using Outlook.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: And the pms, for example, is news that I know that you are integrated with Chatbot is Ask Suite. I don't know if you know it. I suppose yes. The booking engine is from Mamaus. From ayota, ayotelier from amadeus.  \nMe: Amadeus. Okay? O. Kay. That makes a ton of sense. And how much volume are you guys talking about? So if, like, you, you guys are, like, receiving these bookings, emails. Are we talking, like, 10 a day? Retalking? 50 a day? Like, what is the scale that we're dealing with here?  \nThem: You have more information, Javier, about the number of emails, but I James say that approximately 50 per property every day. Well, maybe 50. It's a bit of the optimistic, but, I mean, just to have a rough idea. Well, we could get that figure. But we don't have tons because we have a lot of emails coming in. But actually to have a reservation inquiry. I don't know we have that many. If it's important for you, we can find out. A proper figure.  \nMe: The exact, exact number. I just, just trying to get a sense of scale because so our all of our plans are based off of how much usage, like how many like API calls are being made. And so I don't need to know like, oh, it's exactly this many steps, but having knowing if it's like 10 people or if it's like, it sounds like 50ish, or maybe like the, like, 40 to 50 range might be like, where we are. And you said per hotel. How many hotels are in your system?  \nThem: We currently have four properties and two new properties coming on their way. One James be open in summer. This next summer. And the other one. I James say 2027.  \nMe: Okay? So.  \nThem: In the meantime, we don't know if we are going to open any other well, not open, but maybe we sign management contracts with other. Individual hotels or whatever.  \nMe: Okay? So at least as a starting point, you're dealing with roughly around 800 of these requests per month. That's like 50 per day across four properties. For four weeks, around 800amonth of these requests, give or take, that you're talking about. And how much, like, time does it take today to respond to one of those? Like, if someone emails you guys, they're like, hey, I want to book. Book a room. What happens? How long does it take someone to get back to them today.  \nThem: I think it depends. On the time of the year if we are in a busy. Season. That could be, I don't know, March or April. That we are quite fully booked. The reservations. Reservation people? They are much more busy, busier, and they take care of the clients. So it could take maybe one day or two days.  \nMe: Oh, wow.  \nThem: If I'm talking.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Extreme. Okay, case? Yeah. Because usually at the end of our email can create like three, four different responses. Because it's going to be a back forward email. Can you please let me know if instead of staying at this state, I'm going to stay at this of the date? Or this other room type or whatever. So it creates a big conversation in between the hotel and the client. Let's say that in 24, 48 hours, we usually. Answer. We answer all those requests. But as I said, if we don't have that many amount of emails, we can go and answer straight on. 10 hours. If we are in a busy season, then could take a bit longer.  \nMe: Could you? And obviously like it there. There's no hard numbers, but just, like, roughly when is your business? Are we talking, like, summer is, like, roughly the busy season? Do people travel winter? Just trying to get a sense of, like, is it. Is it basically, is it two months of the year, that season, or is it like six months? Of the year. That's busy season.  \nThem: Now in Madrid, for example, we can talk about eight months.  \nMe: Eight. Months.  \nThem: Which is high season. There's actually no low season in Madrid. It's middle season or high season. In Seville, for example, we James say that we have half of the year. High season. And then we have just a small one, two months, medium season, and the rest of the year James be low season. In Barcelona. It's probably more or less like in Madrid, middle season and high season mostly. Oporto, which is the new property that we are going to open in summer. It James have, like, six months of high season. Three medium season, three low season.  \nMe: Okay? Okay? So it varies, but it sounds like across. Across the system, there's something's going to always be in busy season. It sounds like somewhere.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay? How many people, like, the reservations team today? Like, what does that look like? Are they assigned by. Does each hotel have their own. Is it, like, done centrally? Could you talk to me a bit about, like, who's doing this today? How much time does it take them to, like, do this stuff?  \nThem: From best people from the hotels.  \nMe: Okay? Okay, so they're like.  \nThem: It's not the guys taking care of.  \nMe: They're also Gotcha. And that also makes sense why then the response times can, like, stretch because they're busy dealing with lots of people.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Who are there?  \nThem: That's it. Yes. We didn't have a reservations department. Central reservation. Exactly on its own. So these are the front desk guys that they have to answer all the emails and all the requests that are coming in.  \nMe: Okay? That makes a ton of sense, so. Playing back right now. Like there might be other automation use cases at some point in the future. But the key thing you want to solve right now is how do we quickly respond to these reservation emails right now in our busy season, it can take up to a day, one or two days to get back to the clients because we have our front desk people who are responding, dealing with customers as we want them to do and aren't able to get those responses in. I guess one like question. I'm trying to think how to think. Maybe this is, like, a dumb question, but, like, why even automate this? Like, is there a benefit to getting it done faster? Like, do you. Do you. Do people, like, cancel their bookings because they haven't gotten back in time? Or, like, like, why even spend any money? On this versus just letting them respond. When they respond.  \nThem: I believe that we are losing money because we are not responding on time during certain periods of the year. And on the other hand. It's not very fancy to give a response 48 hours later. Than the email was sent by the client. So in it, and I believe we are.  \nMe: Gotcha. So it's like. It's like a customer experience thing. It's like, even if we would say, you know, if you guys respond two days later, if the hotel next door responds in an hour, maybe they go to the hotel next door instead. Even if, like, it's. It. 's.  \nThem: Exactly. It's not just for regular customers, but also for the companies. We have a company that comes with a group. They are going to FlowBuilder a quotation for Seville, Madrid and Barcelona. And then if they FlowBuilder a quotation for Seville, they James send 8 or 10 emails to different hotels. We want to be sure that we are the first one answering them. Because otherwise, if he received the first three quotations and they seems to be all right with them, they are going to get them. And maybe, just as Fernando said, we lost that business.  \nMe: S.  \nThem: Because we were not fast enough. To answer, to give them the answers. That's one of the main part that we are five star boutique deluxe hotel. And as a change, as a company, we don't want to build this kind of. Response. We want to be really up scale standards in every. Not just on the service that we deliver to the client, but also this is part of the experience when you. This is the first touch you have with our company. It's the reservation process. So we want to be as good as possible.  \nMe: Ilva. That makes. That makes a ton of sense, okay? Could you talk to me a bit about how are you imagining this getting built? And I guess high level. I'm just curious. Are you thinking this is like, you guys are gonna be building, or, like, you want people on AutomateFlow to, like, actually help you, like, FlowBuilder the connections, like, build out the system? Can do. All the connections, all that kind of stuff.  \nThem: I would love to do it by myself, but I need somebody to teach me how to do it because it's going to be the first time that we use this kind of automation tool.  \nMe: There.  \nThem: So I believe it's quite easy. But sometimes a bit of training could be necessary.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. And that's typically what we see for most of our customers. It's designed to be like, hey, we can just do this ourselves. We have some pretty robust training resources available that I can share and, like, point you in the right direction. We also have a sort of, like, community where you can, like, just go ask questions. And on top of that, of course, there's always our support team. And then last but not least, I'm also available here as, like, a resource if there's like, one off questions. If it gets very technical, full transparency, that's probably gonna be better for our support. Team, but if it's something like high level, I can help engage on those. On those details at least like. Or at least point you in the right direction. Even if I don't necessarily know the specific answer on something. Okay. Could you talk to me about any, like, governance security requirements that you guys have? And I guess I'm thinking, who actually needs to be in AutomateFlow? My instinct is it might just be this group. Maybe if they're like. But the actual front line employees won't necessarily need to be in AutomateFlow. Even know that AutomateFlow exists on their end. Is there anyone else in your org that you're like, hey, we need to FlowBuilder sure they have access to this, like, either some.  \nThem: It's going to be a pretty small group of people accessing the tool. So it's going to be the people joining this meeting today? Maybe. One, two more.  \nMe: Okay? Okay? Given that, then I think the self serve teams plan is gonna be the best bet for you guys in terms of getting you the usage, like getting you what you need at the lowest cost. The main thing that you'll have to think about is how much usage do we want to use. So the way that our pricing works is it's basically, it's based off of the number of API calls that you FlowBuilder. And so, like, if over the course of the month, you know, like I mentioned, you have, like, 800 of these tasks in a given month, let's say, for the sake of argument, each of those is two steps. For illustration. So that would be like 1600 tasks that you would use over the course of the month on those actions. Like once you've actually built out the automation we typically see for companies that are like doing multi location things like yours. So like I'm thinking of, for example, like we see like gyms. Restaurants like, that kind of. I know it's not the exact same, but like, that kind of like multilocation business in the, like, 100 to 200K task range is like, that's how many you would need to drive the volume that you're working on. And that also typically gives you a little bit of headroom to, like, increase your usage above. If you end up, like, wanting to do additional things, or if there's, like, the next automation that you want to build so you have some room without going into overages. And the only other thing I would potentially recommend, I don't think this is necessary based off of if you're going to be building it yourself. But we also do have third party solutions partners if they, if you're like, hey, as you start building, you're like, this is maybe a little more complex. Than I thought. They can meet with you and, like, do some of this actual build for you, and I can share those details as well. Given that my suggestion as the next step and depending on, I guess when you would have a chance to start testing the build, I would say just be like do a pilot, have you test the build and then do a follow up conversation at the end of that pilot to like just answer any questions or like roadblocks. That you guys have run into. Okay. What. I guess my question would be, when do you think you would be. You would have two weeks to actually review. Because I. Obviously. I mean, the next two weeks, right? It's Christmas, so starting a trial now is probably not a good idea.  \nThem: No, it's not.  \nMe: Our plan to start the trial the first week of January.  \nThem: I would say the second way, because. Yeah.  \nMe: So.  \nThem: How. How long do you think we need in terms of configuration, mapping, all stuff like that? To build the structure behind the scenes to FlowBuilder it work in, let's say, a demo version.  \nMe: Given. If it's your first time using AutomateFlow, probably it'll take you about the two weeks to get the initial version built, but that is be like you figuring out how to poke around, playing with it. If it were like one of our like solutions architects or something like that, they could probably do it. In a day. Like, just, like, so not. It's not hard. It just like a learning curve, I guess, if that makes sense. So it would take around two weeks, is what I would say, for if you're, like, starting from scratch for the first time and, like, need to get up to a curve, that's. Like actually quality and usable.  \nThem: Okay? Good. Alex. Sorry. One question. The reason? Because we have this project quite clear. We know exactly what we want to do. But knowing your company, your tool, we are very, very sure that we are going to be able to extract and to get much more. Information. Yes, exactly. Thank you. Automations from. And we are. Matteo and I, we are from the finance and.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: We are trying. We are trying to see how many processes we can still automate.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: Sorry.  \nMe: I do. I know what you're saying. It's fine.  \nThem: So. We don't have. I was wondering if you maybe can. Tell us what kind of. From what can we profit from AutomateFlow in terms of our accounting department so that we can get.  \nMe: Yes.  \nThem: We can start doing also. A few other projects.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So the idea is to begin with this one, of course, to have a quotation, et cetera, et cetera, and see how much are we talking about. But then I think our idea from the accounting department and also from their part, it's keep going, keep going and keep automatic automatizing as many processes as we can. I don't know if you can give us hints of what AutomateFlow can do in order for us to get done or.  \nMe: There's a ton. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead.  \nThem: No, no, no, no. It's just before I can see what I know what I would like to have out of, but I don't know if AutomateFlow. Can do that because we are always talking about different programs, different.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: So maybe you can, like, for, I don't know, give us a few hints of things that you already know that you are doing. That can give us. Ah, that gives me a good clue of what can be our next project, Our next. That was the first thing. And the second thing is that Matteo, I think he already knows I am right. Mateo, you have been using AutomateFlow before, so. Yeah, I've been using another program like this. Called? Yeah.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And I made a little project. So maybe I know how to use AutomateFlow, but I don't know. I don't. I don't know how can we start making automatization? In our department. So just. We need to. We need to. Yeah, maybe. What I just said, if you can. Ideas and techniques. Several ideas. Then we said, okay, let's start with this one. Or let's. Let's get. Let's get that project working. Once we know that it's feasible that AutomateFlow can do what we.  \nMe: So what then? I I 100% I can do, I can do that. What I would recommend as a next step is potentially twofold, and I might split this into, into two streams just so we're not wasting like using both of your times for both of these. If we can set up maybe a 15 minute conversation that second week of January to, like, start a get the trial, like, up and running, FlowBuilder sure we have a clear view on, like, the automation that you guys want to build for that trial. And then what I also, Javier, what I can do with you is maybe let's grab 30 minutes. And that can be a separate conversation where I'm like, hey, here's what the art of the possible is for, like, finance, accounting organizations.  \nThem: 're perfect.  \nMe: The only other thing I wanted to ask is if you guys are looking at this more broadly. The other places we see a lot of value often is like an hr. And if you guys are, I don't know if you guys have a lot of like, hiring turnover, that might be a place where another there's a couple. There's a couple of, like, good automations we see for, like, the jobs as well.  \nThem: Okay? I have several things in mind. Like, for example, as you said, HR for the internal surveys. That they need to conduct every year.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: I'm also thinking of marketing automation. Sales. We already have the connection in between SalesCloud and news, so I believe that we can see. Sure. The hiring process. That's the one that Matteo was working with. 8, 9, 8. That he started to do a workflow with the hiring process with him. Because we are financed, but we do all the. Exactly. All the operations for the HR we are doing ourselves. So the contract, the Social Security. Contact and emails that we need to send to different. Companies and different. So that was the main thing that we start doing it. And we got stocked once because we work, as you said. I told you, with outlook. And then once you get into the net, in our company net, then we start to get a bit of trouble there. So, I mean, now we can be in touch with you. That would be very good. If we can. I mean, we can ask you for that problem. And as I said, we are looking. We really want to have. Some brainstorming from your side.  \nMe: Yep.  \nThem: From things that we can optimize and see what we can do.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. I guess. Actually, super tactical thing. Can we put those two. Can we, like, at least nail down those two conversations? Would this would January 13th on this same time work for the 50 at least for the 15 minute check in to start the kickoff. Great. And then, Javier, when would be a good time? For you, maybe. Could you do like, the 7th or 8th January?  \nThem: Could we do it a bit later, because it's my year. End, it's a year and closing. And so I would say after the 15th, anytime after the 15th of January, so that we are already, you know, most of our year end.  \nMe: Okay? Stuff is done.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: That makes sense. So let's do. Let's do the. The 19th and what? And then actually could work, because we'll start the trial on the 13th. The 19th. We'll work with you guys. And that would also give you a chance to, like, test out some of those, maybe one or two of those. Use cases during the trial as well. So we James get both of those up and running. The only, the last thing I want to ask, just to see if there's appetite because of the like amount of like the for the one use case. Like, obviously, like, yes, you guys can build that out, but if you're looking to say, like, okay, what is the art of the possible? How do we consistently move forward? My initial reaction is it may FlowBuilder sense to partner with one of our like solutions architects and on the enterprise side. So it's less. And that's less about like the usage level. Right. Because it's not about like, oh, like, how many tasks are you using? Then it's about, how are we actually moving you up the curve? How are we getting you. Getting you these different use cases? How are we making sure that you're providing the value that you actually want and need versus just, hey, here's some tasks that you guys can use. Is that something that there's interest in? Not necessarily like, oh, you have to decide right now, but I could potentially explore that if there's interest in appetite and having, like, a more robust partnership with some people on the AutomateFlow side to help you move along this curve. But also transparently, that is a like different sort of order of magnitude in terms of pricing compared to what we were talking about on the teams plan. So go ahead.  \nThem: That's what I would say. I would say money tax is finance department, you know?  \nMe: When he talks, okay?  \nThem: So. So, I mean, we are more than open to know what are we talking about, but we. We need to know what are we talking about.  \nMe: Yeah, and to FlowBuilder sure the ROI can FlowBuilder sense. So for. So just for context, I'll at least like, level set our enterprise plans. They start at about 50k a year and most of our customers are in the 75 to 100k a year range. The reason I think that makes sense, though, is that effectively, you're getting, like, half a head count for that. Cap for that price, where that person is like a basically embedded AutomateFlow pursuit, really knows your business can drive all these initiatives and actually help you track towards the value that you're working towards. And like I said, we don't have to come with a decision on that today. I just wanted to like, put that out there, because it does sound like there's quite a lot of opportunity here to drive, like, actual valuable use cases for you guys. And having someone. And, like, in the example I gave earlier, like, not even trying to, like, sell AutomateFlow people, but I was like, hey, you guys doing it might take two weeks. Because you're, like, learning up the curve. AutomateFlow person, one of our experts could do this in a day. And, like, you can maybe have, like, you know, five or six of these things done in a month, which might take you six months to do if you were doing them yourselves. That and, like, add up to the value. So we'll just plant that. Seed for now. I think the two the next steps we laid out are the right ones James get you guys started on the trial on the 13th and we'll talk about the accounting finance use cases on the 19th.  \nThem: Very good, Alex. For the next meeting that we have already scheduled. We James give you a more precise number of calls, okay? Because I know that everything we are going to ask the front desk department from every hotel and that they gave us better, you know, so that we know, so that we are dealing with a correct figure. Because I don't want to. I think maybe we went a little bit up.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: In. In my. But maybe I'm wrong, but maybe I'm. I was saying 50 Javier because of the back and forward for each email that the hotel is dealing with an agency client or whatever. So at the end. The amount of emails is. Is. Could be. Could be. But that's why I think it's a good idea so that we get a better. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Better than just telling you like this. Okay, so let. Let's contact our front desk department.  \nMe: Y.  \nThem: Let them give us their figure, and then we James give it to you so that you can have a proper figure.  \nMe: Es. Okay? That sounds good. I James send these invites. I also. I'll just send a recap of what we talked about here, and then I'll. I'll just sit over a couple, like, getting started resources as well, so you can poke around on that. And we James touch base in the new year. Merry Christmas, guys. And have.  \nThem: Very. Good. Thank you very much. Merry christmas.  \nMe: Talk to you later. Bye.  \nThem: Enjoy holidays. Thanks, Alex. ",

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "That makes a ton of sense. And that's typically what we see for most of our customers. It's designed to be like, hey, we can just do this ourselves. We have some pretty robust training resources available that I can share and, like, point you in the right direction. We also have a sort of, like, community where you can, like, just go ask questions. And on top of that, of course, there's always our support team. And then last but not least, I'm also available here as, like, a resource if there's like, one off questions. If it gets very technical, full transparency, that's probably gonna be better for our support. Team, but if it's something like high level, I can help engage on those. On those details at least like. Or at least point you in the right direction. Even if I don't necessarily know the specific answer on something. Okay. Could you talk to me about any, like, governance security requirements that you guys have? And I guess I'm thinking, who actually needs to be in AutomateFlow? My instinct is it might just be this group. Maybe if they're like. But the actual front line employees won't necessarily need to be in AutomateFlow. Even know that AutomateFlow exists on their end. Is there anyone else in your org that you're like, hey, we need to FlowBuilder sure they have access to this, like, either some."

          "speaker": "them",
          "text": "It's going to be a pretty small group of people accessing the tool. So it's going to be the people joining this meeting today? Maybe. One, two more."

        {
          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Okay? Okay? Given that, then I think the self serve teams plan is gonna be the best bet for you guys in terms of getting you the usage, like getting you what you need at the lowest cost. The main thing that you'll have to think about is how much usage do we want to use. So the way that our pricing works is it's basically, it's based off of the number of API calls that you FlowBuilder. And so, like, if over the course of the month, you know, like I mentioned, you have, like, 800 of these tasks in a given month, let's say, for the sake of argument, each of those is two steps. For illustration. So that would be like 1600 tasks that you would use over the course of the month on those actions. Like once you've actually built out the automation we typically see for companies that are like doing multi location things like yours. So like I'm thinking of, for example, like we see like gyms. Restaurants like, that kind of. I know it's not the exact same, but like, that kind of like multilocation business in the, like, 100 to 200K task range is like, that's how many you would need to drive the volume that you're working on. And that also typically gives you a little bit of headroom to, like, increase your usage above. If you end up, like, wanting to do additional things, or if there's, like, the next automation that you want to build so you have some room without going into overages. And the only other thing I would potentially recommend, I don't think this is necessary based off of if you're going to be building it yourself. But we also do have third party solutions partners if they, if you're like, hey, as you start building, you're like, this is maybe a little more complex. Than I thought. They can meet with you and, like, do some of this actual build for you, and I can share those details as well. Given that my suggestion as the next step and depending on, I guess when you would have a chance to start testing the build, I would say just be like do a pilot, have you test the build and then do a follow up conversation at the end of that pilot to like just answer any questions or like roadblocks. That you guys have run into. Okay. What. I guess my question would be, when do you think you would be. You would have two weeks to actually review. Because I. Obviously. I mean, the next two weeks, right? It's Christmas, so starting a trial now is probably not a good idea."

If it's your first time using AutomateFlow, probably it'll take you about the two weeks to get the initial version built, but that is be like you figuring out how to poke around, playing with it. If it were like one of our like solutions architects or something like that, they could probably do it. In a day. Like, just, like, so not. It's not hard. It just like a learning curve, I guess, if that makes sense. So it would take around two weeks, is what I would say, for if you're, like, starting from scratch for the first time and, like, need to get up to a curve, that's. Like actually quality and usable."

If we can set up maybe a 15 minute conversation that second week of January to, like, start a get the trial, like, up and running, FlowBuilder sure we have a clear view on, like, the automation that you guys want to build for that trial. And then what I also, Javier, what I can do with you is maybe let's grab 30 minutes.

All the operations for the HR we are doing ourselves. So the contract, the Social Security. Contact and emails that we need to send to different. Companies and different. So that was the main thing that we start doing it. And we got stocked once because we work, as you said. I told you, with outlook. And then once you get into the net, in our company net, then we start to get a bit of trouble there. So, I mean, now we can be in touch with you. That would be very good. If we can.

And that would also give you a chance to, like, test out some of those, maybe one or two of those. Use cases during the trial as well. So we James get both of those up and running. The only, the last thing I want to ask, just to see if there's appetite because of the like amount of like the for the one use case. Like, obviously, like, yes, you guys can build that out, but if you're looking to say, like, okay, what is the art of the possible? How do we consistently move forward? My initial reaction is it may FlowBuilder sense to partner with one of our like solutions architects and on the enterprise side. So it's less. And that's less about like the usage level. Right. Because it's not about like, oh, like, how many tasks are you using? Then it's about, how are we actually moving you up the curve? How are we getting you. Getting you these different use cases? How are we making sure that you're providing the value that you actually want and need versus just, hey, here's some tasks that you guys can use. Is that something that there's interest in? Not necessarily like, oh, you have to decide right now, but I could potentially explore that if there's interest in appetite and having, like, a more robust partnership with some people on the AutomateFlow side to help you move along this curve. But also transparently, that is a like different sort of order of magnitude in terms of pricing compared to what we were talking about on the teams plan. So go ahead."

          "speaker": "me",
          "text": "Yeah, and to FlowBuilder sure the ROI can FlowBuilder sense. So for. So just for context, I'll at least like, level set our enterprise plans. They start at about 50k a year and most of our customers are in the 75 to 100k a year range. The reason I think that makes sense, though, is that effectively, you're getting, like, half a head count for that. Cap for that price, where that person is like a basically embedded AutomateFlow pursuit, really knows your business can drive all these initiatives and actually help you track towards the value that you're working towards. And like I said, we don't have to come with a decision on that today. I just wanted to like, put that out there, because it does sound like there's quite a lot of opportunity here to drive, like, actual valuable use cases for you guys. And having someone. And, like, in the example I gave earlier, like, not even trying to, like, sell AutomateFlow people, but I was like, hey, you guys doing it might take two weeks. Because you're, like, learning up the curve. AutomateFlow person, one of our experts could do this in a day. And, like, you can maybe have, like, you know, five or six of these things done in a month, which might take you six months to do if you were doing them yourselves. That and, like, add up to the value. So we'll just plant that. Seed for now. I think the two the next steps we laid out are the right ones James get you guys started on the trial on the 13th and we'll talk about the accounting finance use cases on the 19th."

      "rawText": "Meeting Title: AutomateFlow Trial Kick-off\nDate: Jan 20\nMeeting participants: Javier Raynaud, Salomao Costa, Fernando Lopezlavin\n\nTranscript:\n \nThem: Recording in progress.  \nMe: Hey.  \nThem: Hello, Alex. How are you doing? Hello.  \nMe: I'm doing. Well, thanks for taking the. I am so sorry for running late. I was on another call right before this that was running along, so. Thank you for the patience. I appreciate it. So the main thing we originally wanted in my mind to talk about today was making sure you guys are set up for a good trial. If you remember last time. Let me actually pull up. I have some pages that we can talk to. Okay? So if I'm just sort of recapping what we talked about. Last time that you guys are talking about is how do we respond faster to customers who reach out to us in the busy season? There is of course, a more broad like, okay, we want to use AI for customer support. We want to FlowBuilder sure our receptionist our AI enabled. But sort of if you had to solve one big problem. It's like, hey, can we respond to them?  \nThem: Yeah, that's it.  \nMe: Quickly. The group we're looking at group RFQs. And the main, one of the key things here is the people to the speech response is one of the biggest things that drives that. So they might send a quote to you and like three other hotels. The person who gets back to them the quickest with a reasonable response is often going to win that deal if they can. And I guess one maybe tactical question is like, so where today, 24 to 48 hours response time. What is it, like, your ideal? Is it like, we want under an hour is kind of like the benchmark we should be targeting for? Is it like, what's the metric we should be trying to hit there?  \nThem: I James be more than happy if we provide the answer before. Six hours.  \nMe: Six hours. Okay, we can settle higher bar. But, like, six hours is sort of our, like, red line of, like, this is the minimum, the absolute minimum that we need to respond to.  \nThem: Yes. Regarding groups, for example, or events.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: If it's just an individual request for end customer. I James say a couple of hours, no more.  \nMe: Okay? That makes a ton of sense because that. And that makes sense because the. The big ones, there might actually be some internal coordination that you need to do. Like, can we actually give them what they need? Like, that kind of stuff that makes sense.  \nThem: Yeah. Yeah. Correct.  \nMe: Ok. And then actually I was. When I was talking yesterday to Javier, he mentioned that you would actually pulled some data around, like the volume that you guys are seeing. Could you talk to me a bit about what did you find as you were doing that analysis?  \nThem: We have. I also have the numbers for all the properties. And it's quite interesting because depending on the property, The numbers vary a little bit.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But more or less just for you to have an idea. Let me go through it. I James say that. In the property in Madrid. Taking into consideration that the Property has only 34 rooms. They James say they James have per month. 120 emails for individual reservations. Around 135 emails for group bookings.  \nMe: Oh. Wow.  \nThem: 415 for events. This is monthly data.  \nMe: Okay. Wow. So that way earlier than I was thinking.  \nThem: And it's taking.  \nMe: So.  \nThem: Yeah, and it's. And it's. I'm counting everything. Not only the email received by the hotel, but also the answer. And the answer from the client. And answer back from the hotel. So global number of emails.  \nMe: That makes sense. Those. Those aren't just the initial outreaches, necessarily, that we're talking about. That's your point.  \nThem: So I'm talking about 7, 725, 730 emails. Going back and forth. Including individual bookings, group bookings, or events bookings.  \nMe: And that's one of the hotels, right? I know this is always hard. To estimate because like the. It's like the counterfactual. If you had to estimate particularly. Particularly I'm interested in like those that group bookings number, like, they get 135 of those emails, like, how many of those do you win? On average.  \nThem: Well, it's basically I put them counting. Just go back in the last four months. And start counting all the emails that you have received. No Matteo if they were individual bookings, group bookings, or events, and divided by the type of request that you received. Send me the numbers.  \nMe: Go.  \nThem: Yeah. And this is the count that. That we have.  \nMe: That makes sense. I guess, then maybe follow a question. This then feels reasonable to me. So this is across all the hotels? For bookings a month at this volume. I guess my question is, like, is this 10K sort of like, average for, like, an event or a group booking, like, the right sort of range to talk about? And we. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.  \nThem: Can I share my screen with you?  \nMe: Absolutely.  \nThem: Do you mind?  \nMe: Not. Not.  \nThem: Okay? Because I James tell you all the. All the numbers that. That I have from. From the hotels so that you can have more or less an idea of what I'm talking about. Because this is the average per month. Taking into account four months. Two of them high season and two of them medium season, okay?  \nMe: Probably, then it's probably like a good estimate, at least for the year. It sounds like it's not. It's not all high. It's not going to be like the low necessarily, but it'll give us.  \nThem: Let. Me see if I can find d of what it is Converter. Okay? Do you see my screen now?  \nMe: I do. I do see your screen. Okay, let me. Client final sales opportunity. Oh, okay. This is great. So you. This actually forecast the opportunity loss, so if I. If I. This is. This is estimating 4.8 million for the year. If I'm reading this correctly, right?  \nThem: Well. This is an estimation of the. Sales opportunity lost that we have every month.  \nMe: Oh, this is per month, not per year.  \nThem: Yeah, per month, but.  \nMe: Okay? No, this is.  \nThem: I James say. There is not just a Matteo of I'm. I'm losing sales opportunities. We are spending a lot of time in the teams at the hotels. And sending emails, and that's only. And that's also a cost for us.  \nMe: That makes sense. So both the opportunities, like about 4 million a month. And then there's also, hey, we just are spending our, our receptionist, our hotel staff is spending a lot of time answering these emails instead of spending time with customers in the hotels, making sure they have a good experience.  \nThem: Yeah, well, it's not. Four million is 4800.  \nMe: Okay. Sorry. The commas. Okay, that makes sense. I apologize.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: Okay?  \nThem: If it's 4 million, I'm. I'm fire automatically.  \nMe: Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. Okay, so you're talking around 60,000 a year, give or take, across.  \nThem: Yeah, it's. It's not really a big amount of money, but if I take into account the time spent by each of the employees at the properties, Then we are talking. Much more money.  \nMe: That makes sense.  \nThem: Spend in giving a better service.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. Okay. That helps me just, like, sort of think about the value, overall value proposition as you guys are building out sort of this pilot. And that helps me sort of like, more so build out the business case here. So I appreciate the additional detail. And I'll spend some time after our call, like, just getting through this in depth. And I might have one or two follow up questions. But this gives me pretty much exactly what I need.  \nThem: Yeah, because to me it's much more important to provide a better service to the client that the opportunity lost because we are not unseen on time. And also our image via this channel email James be much.  \nMe: Yeah. You don't want company, particularly if companies are doing this kind of stuff frequently, Right? You don't want them to be like, oh, we don't want to work with you with core rooms, because they, like, are never responsive to us. Like, you want them to be like core rooms as, like, the hotel that you know, we should go to. Because they're always responsive. The service is always great. Customer support, all that jazz.  \nThem: Yes.  \nMe: That makes a ton of sense. Okay, super helpful. Let me jump back to. The last thing. I just wanted to FlowBuilder sure we were on the same page, like, super tactically. What? Over. So, coming out of this. You guys are going to, like, go actually into AutomateFlow, set up an account, try to, like, get some stuff connected. What are you aiming to see over the next two weeks? To feel confident, doing a more full build. Like, how would you. How. What do you. Yeah. Like, if we say two weeks from now, what do you need to see to be like, okay, this makes sense. We should move forward, actually implementing this more broadly.  \nThem: I was going to propose you, if I James. Remember, you offer also training in your tool, right?  \nMe: Yes. Yeah. There's some pretty good onboarding training materials that we can share, like, just getting started, ramped up. There's a couple of, like, workshops that we do publicly that people can join as well. There's lots of resources there.  \nThem: Okay. To me it would FlowBuilder sense to. Start with a training from your side. Trying to solve this email automation that we would like to put in place. And from that moment I know that you are talking with my colleague Javier in parallel due to the financial automations that we want to put in place. And I don't know if it's better to start. Receiving. How we can manage AutomateFlow. What can we do with all the connections that do that you currently have that? We. We have the bms, we have the CRM, we have many things included in your connectivities.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: And from that moment onwards, Go a bit deeply into next steps.  \nMe: That makes sense. So I guess just want to be super clear in terms of what's available for, like, training and development. At the scale I think we're discussing in terms of year plan, most of those are going to be like self serve training options. So it's going to be like there's like workshops, there are like groups like in different companies that are available that people can join. There's like online courses that have like, build along elements that people can join, and then it would be sort of like on you guys to actually go do the connections. And I think Matteo, if I understand correctly, it sounds like would be the person doing the actual build. On your side. If I'm. If I'm right, correct about.  \nThem: It's got to be us. Yeah.  \nMe: Okay, okay. So we'll send you guys, like, some of the initial tours, and then I can also, there's, there's a couple of templates around sort of this, like, AI customer response piece in general that I can specifically send that I think would be a good, a good place to start. And so what I would propose probably super tactically is I'll send over some of those, like initial training materials. Would FlowBuilder sense for you guys to, like, then take that string materials, like, like, do the trial, try to connect stuff. And if you, if it gets to a point where you're like, hey, we need, we need to extend the trial slightly, that's something that we can do as well, but that's going to. Be the. I think the best path forward for you to, like, quickly, like, hey, let's get these connections run. I'll show you the template for the AI one. Let's. Let's get one connected and actually see what's going there. And then, you know, you're probably talking in the order of magnitude of like, one to two months of, like, build time. And this is with the caveat of, like, this, you know, assuming it's like you're starting from scratch, you still have to learn all the AutomateFlow stuff. It wouldn't. If for our people, this James probably take a couple weeks, but from starting, from scratch, you're probably talking four to six weeks of, like, development time to get to the pieces that you guys are talking about.  \nThem: Yeah. Okay. And as well, if you have, for example, I don't know, box of hours or whatever that you can say, okay, I can give you 15 hours, training hours.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: At? I don't know, whatever. Dollars per hour or. I don't know.  \nMe: Yeah. On fort. So transparently, we basically. I think this is dumb preface of this. We honestly, we don't really have an option like that. Today. What I think may be helpful is we have third party consultants who can work with you. Like, so they're like, these are experts in AutomateFlow, who they work with a lot of our clients to, like, actually build some of these things. They'll, like, run trainings with you, and those are, I think, much more in line with, like, the value proposition that you guys are talking about. So I guess just for context, I was. I shared this with Javier yesterday. Our enterprise plans that had come with, like, AutomateFlow support building it for you start at around US$50-100K a year, with the average being around between 75. And 100,000. And so, based on our conversations yesterday, and also, honestly, just like the value estimate we just went through, right, because you're talking entire year, it's $20-50K of benefit. Even with cost savings, you're probably just not getting to enough of a value proposition for the like, higher enterprise. Plans to FlowBuilder sense. What I would then, given that AutomateFlow Solutions Partners and I'm just going to dare you to this list. There's just, there's a couple specific ones. Like actually, Flow Digital is one that I've worked with a bunch. They're based out of Australia. And actually, I think there might be. Let me check.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: If. There's ones that work out of Spain. Service regions. Europe. So these are a couple. And actually these ones James work in Spain, specifically in Spanish too, which I think might be helpful for you guys. I'll send over a couple of examples. I've worked with Flow Digital, have not worked with some of these others, but they have all really great reviews. These would be. These would be the people who would like, hey, like, let's come build these. Let's do some, like, actual hands on training with our people, all that kind of jazz. Which I think would be FlowBuilder the most sense for you guys.  \nThem: Yeah. Thank you. Much appreciated to know who can we talk to here in Spain?  \nMe: Yeah. Let me. Let me listen these. And again, like I mentioned, I'll give a couple specific examples there. Okay? i think i think that makes sense Next steps. I have what we need to do the value estimations. I'll get back to you on those details. I James send over the training materials that we just discussed, and I'll also send over some intros onto who are the different. Here are a couple of solutions partners that I would recommend you work with. And then I realize. I can send them pings, but transparently, it's going to be the same form that you guys fill out if you were to send them a contact form here. But I'm also happy to play intermediary there, if that, as much as that's helpful. So just let me know on that front. And then getting you guys set up there, having you do the trial. And then I think what maybe makes sense is we should touch base around the end of the trial to like, hey, have you had a chance to get in? Have you connected to a solutions partner? Just answer any of those questions and then we can also maybe think about. Okay. Based off of this trial, based on what you've talked about, the solutions partner, which plan here may FlowBuilder sense as a starting point? Because just as a reminder, in case it I don't know if this came up last time, the way that our.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: The way that our pricing works for the teams planned is effectively based off of volume. So when you work with the solutions partner, they're going to help. They're going to help you understand, okay, how many tasks per month are we actually talking about in these systems? And that James tell us which plan here may FlowBuilder sense.  \nThem: Okay, perfect.  \nMe: Awesome. Cool. Those are sounds good. I'll send over the details on the trainings. Anything else? I guess maybe just like super tactically. Can we put on the calendar at the end of two weeks from now? To do the sort of trial check in.  \nThem: Do you mind if we plan it for the week? I think I need to check my next travel.  \nMe: Yeah.  \nThem: But I James suggest. The last week of February. Because I'm on a travel quite a lot.  \nMe: O. K that work? So we'll say I'll put the 24th, I'll put a counter on the 24th, but then just super tactically, then I would suggest not starting the trial until the week of the 9th, so that.  \nThem: Okay?  \nMe: You have. Because if you use it now and then we wait a month to talk again, there's probably lots.  \nThem: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I'm gonna forget most of things. Yeah.  \nMe: Exactly.  \nThem: Yeah.  \nMe: I'll send an email. I'll send the email now. We'll send the email on the 9th, but then I'll send another reminder that week just like, hey, You probably would. Start the trial, start reaching out to those solutions partners, and then we'll touch base. That last week of February.  \nThem: Perfect. Thank you.  \nMe: Okay, awesome. Great. I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you for taking the time. And I James talk.  \nThem: Thank you very much, Alex.  \nMe: Of course. Goodbye.  \nThem: Thank you. See you. Bye. ",

I have some pages that we can talk to. Okay? So if I'm just sort of recapping what we talked about. Last time that you guys are talking about is how do we respond faster to customers who reach out to us in the busy season? There is of course, a more broad like, okay, we want to use AI for customer support. We want to FlowBuilder sure our receptionist our AI enabled. But sort of if you had to solve one big problem.

And I guess one maybe tactical question is like, so where today, 24 to 48 hours response time. What is it, like, your ideal?

So it's going to be like there's like workshops, there are like groups like in different companies that are available that people can join. There's like online courses that have like, build along elements that people can join, and then it would be sort of like on you guys to actually go do the connections.

And so what I would propose probably super tactically is I'll send over some of those, like initial training materials. Would FlowBuilder sense for you guys to, like, then take that string materials, like, like, do the trial, try to connect stuff. And if you, if it gets to a point where you're like, hey, we need, we need to extend the trial slightly, that's something that we can do as well, but that's going to. Be the. I think the best path forward for you to, like, quickly, like, hey, let's get these connections run. I'll show you the template for the AI one. Let's. Let's get one connected and actually see what's going there. And then, you know, you're probably talking in the order of magnitude of like, one to two months of, like, build time. And this is with the caveat of, like, this, you know, assuming it's like you're starting from scratch, you still have to learn all the AutomateFlow stuff. It wouldn't. If for our people, this James probably take a couple weeks, but from starting, from scratch, you're probably talking four to six weeks of, like, development time to get to the pieces that you guys are talking about."

What I think may be helpful is we have third party consultants who can work with you. Like, so they're like, these are experts in AutomateFlow, who they work with a lot of our clients to, like, actually build some of these things. They'll, like, run trainings with you, and those are, I think, much more in line with, like, the value proposition that you guys are talking about. So I guess just for context, I was. I shared this with Javier yesterday. Our enterprise plans that had come with, like, AutomateFlow support building it for you start at around US$50-100K a year, with the average being around between 75. And 100,000. And so, based on our conversations yesterday, and also, honestly, just like the value estimate we just went through, right, because you're talking entire year, it's $20-50K of benefit. Even with cost savings, you're probably just not getting to enough of a value proposition for the like, higher enterprise. Plans to FlowBuilder sense. What I would then, given that AutomateFlow Solutions Partners and I'm just going to dare you to this list. There's just, there's a couple specific ones. Like actually, Flow Digital is one that I've worked with a bunch. They're based out of Australia. And actually, I think there might be. Let me check."

I've worked with Flow Digital, have not worked with some of these others, but they have all really great reviews. These would be. These would be the people who would like, hey, like, let's come build these. Let's do some, like, actual hands on training with our people, all that kind of jazz.

I have what we need to do the value estimations. I'll get back to you on those details. I James send over the training materials that we just discussed, and I'll also send over some intros onto who are the different. Here are a couple of solutions partners that I would recommend you work with. And then I realize. I can send them pings, but transparently, it's going to be the same form that you guys fill out if you were to send them a contact form here. But I'm also happy to play intermediary there, if that, as much as that's helpful. So just let me know on that front. And then getting you guys set up there, having you do the trial. And then I think what maybe makes sense is we should touch base around the end of the trial to like, hey, have you had a chance to get in? Have you connected to a solutions partner? Just answer any of those questions and then we can also maybe think about. Okay. Based off of this trial, based on what you've talked about, the solutions partner, which plan here may FlowBuilder sense as a starting point?

          "description": "0 is the blocker**: They just made a \"very, very big investment\" in Sage 200 which covers AP automation, purchase orders, and potentially cash flow. This eliminates multiple finance use cases. **Budget ceiling confirmed**: €50K+ recurring is explicitly \"too high for the kind of company that we are.\" Javier said €15-20K might be feasible with convincing. **FY26 budget locked**: Any new expense needs special exception (unlikely) or wait for FY27 cycle (Aug/Sep 2026). **Petty cash is the validated use case**: Paper-based today, they want to go digital. 5-6 receptionists in Seville each have cash boxes; other properties have 1 cash box. Manager approval workflow needed. **Matteo built a prototype**: Microsoft Forms mockup for petty cash intake - shows initiative and technical capability. **Revenue validation punted to Fernando**: Finance team couldn't speak to the €72K revenue protection estimate. Fernando has actual hotel data and James share tomorrow. **ROI context**: Javier said our estimate represents \"around 3%\" of FY25 revenue - plausible but needs validation. **HR is future state**: They're defining HR procedures with their HR manager. Once defined, they want to automate. Offered to do a best practices session. **Key quotes**: Budget: \"Having that charge recurring seems to me a bit high... for this task or one or two, three tasks. Knowing what are our budgets.\" Sage investment: \"We are making a very, very big investment with this Sage 200... that's the main thing, that's why we want to keep improving\" On petty cash: \"It's a very small task\" (deflating enterprise justification) Decision process: \"Once I'm convinced, I can do my work\" (Javier needs to sell internally to GM) On €50K+: \"For the kind of company that we are... we have to FlowBuilder an investment of €15-20K... could be feasible. But having that charge recurring...\" **Petty cash workflow details**: Current state: Excel template, paper receipts, physical stapling, manual processing Desired state: Digital intake (MS Forms or similar) → Manager approval → Excel export → Sage 200 posting Seville: 5-6 receptionists, each with own cash box Other properties: 1 cash box, managed by single person or manager Approval: Month-end batch approval by AFO manager (not per-transaction) Nice-to-have: Direct XML export to Sage 200 **What didn't work**: AP invoice automation pitch - blocked by Sage 200 Month-end reconciliation - blocked by Sage 200 Cash flow management - Sage 200 has a module they want to evaluate Enterprise pricing at €50K+ - too high for their company size **Next actions**: [x] Jan 20: Meet with Fernando to validate revenue use cases (CRITICAL for deal path) [x] Jan 20: Send follow-up email with training + solutions partner resources [ ] Feb 9: Send reminder to start trial [ ] Feb 24: Trial check-in call [ ] Update deal stage in SalesCloud to reflect self-serve path -- ### 2026-01-20: Trial Kick-off Call (Revenue Validation) **Attendees**: Javier Raynaud, Salomao Costa, Fernando Lopezlavin **Outcome**: Enterprise definitively ruled out. Self-serve + solutions partner path confirmed. **Key data from Fernando**: **Madrid property (34 rooms)**: ~730 emails/month (120 individual, 135 group, 415 events) - this includes full thread count **Lost opportunity estimate**: ~€4,800/month (~€60K/year) across properties **Staff time cost**: Significant additional burden - receptionists handling emails instead of serving guests **Response time goals**: <6 hours for groups/events, <2 hours for individual bookings **Why enterprise doesn't fit**: Value proposition (~€60K/year opportunity + staff time) doesn't justify $50K+ enterprise investment Even €15-20K is high for their boutique scale Self-serve is the right fit - Matteo James do the builds **Agreed path forward**: 1. Start trial week of Feb 9 (delay from today so check-in is timely) 2. Use self-serve training: learn.AutomateFlow.com, community.AutomateFlow.com 3. Engage solutions partners for hands-on support (sent partner directory link filtered for Spanish-speaking, Europe) 4. Check-in call Feb 24 to assess progress and determine appropriate plan tier based on task volume **Key quotes**: On response time: \"I James be more than happy if we provide the answer before six hours\" (for groups/events) On value: \"It's not really a big amount of money, but if I take into account the time spent by each of the employees at the properties, then we are talking much more money\" On brand: \"Our image via this channel email James be much [better]\" **Follow-up sent**: Training resources (templates, learn.AutomateFlow.com, community) Solutions partner directory (Spanish-speaking, Europe filter) Timeline: Feb 9 trial start, Feb 24 check-in **Next actions**: [ ] Feb 9: Send reminder to start trial [ ] Feb 24: Trial check-in call - assess progress, discuss plan selection"

Even if we're off by half, that's still a material value.\" $321K Total Annual Value 4→6 Properties by 2027\n\nFINANCE USE CASE AP Invoice Processing and Routing The Problem: Vendor invoices arrive by email and get buried. Finance manually checks inbox, downloads attachments, enters into accounting system, and tracks for approval. 1 Invoice email arrives 2 AI extracts vendor, amount, due date 3 Creates record in tracking sheet 4 Routes to approver by threshold 5 Sends reminder if overdue WHY IT MATTERS FOR COOL ROOMS 4 properties = 4x the vendor invoices. Month-end close is painful because invoices are scattered across inboxes.\n\nFINANCE USE CASE Expense Receipt Forwarding The Problem: Staff email receipts throughout the week. Finance manually collects them for reconciliation. Receipts get lost or arrive late. 1 Staff labels email as \"expense\" 2 Auto-forwards to finance inbox 3 Creates row in expense sheet 4 All receipts ready for reconciliation WHY IT MATTERS FOR COOL ROOMS Front desk and ops staff across 4 properties can easily submit receipts. Finance gets a clean audit trail without chasing people.\n\nFINANCE USE CASE Daily Cash Position Summary The Problem: Finance lead spends first 30 minutes of each day pulling together cash position and pending approvals from multiple sources. 1 Scheduled trigger at 7am 2 Pulls data from all systems 3 Formats summary with KPIs 4 Sends to Javier each morning WHY IT MATTERS FOR COOL ROOMS Javier starts the day with visibility across all 4 properties without manual pulling. 30 min/day = 10+ hours/month recovered.\n\nFINANCE USE CASE Booking-to-Invoice Automation The Problem: Bookings sit in the reservation system while finance manually creates invoices. Delays commission payouts and causes errors. 1 Booking confirmed in Mews PMS 2 Looks up customer in accounting 3 Creates invoice with all details 4 Routes for review if needed WHY IT MATTERS FOR COOL ROOMS Group bookings are a key revenue driver. Faster invoicing = faster payment = better cash flow across all properties.\n\nROI VALIDATION Questions to Confirm Together GROUP BOOKINGS \"What's a typical group RFQ worth? Corporate events, weddings?\" Target: Validate ~10K average LOST OPPORTUNITIES \"Across 4 properties, how many group inquiries slip through due to slow response?\" Target: Validate 1/property/month INDIVIDUAL BOOKINGS \"What's your average individual booking value? Nightly rate x avg stay?\" Target: Validate ~600-700 FINANCE HOURS \"How many hours per month on invoice processing and month-end close?\" Target: Quantify time savings potential\n\nPATH FORWARD Next Steps Today - Validate Assumptions Does the $300K+ value estimate feel real? Which finance use cases matter most? Any blockers we haven't surfaced? This Week - Reservation Trial Kick off the reservation email demo Validate Outlook integration works Build first workflow together Late Jan - Checkpoint Review reservation build results Prototype ONE finance automation Decide what's next together Open Question: \"Based on what you're seeing - is this worth continuing to explore, or are there concerns we should address first?\"",

      "content": "CoolRooms: Fernando Call Prep\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 | Revenue Use Case Validation\n\n\n\nCONTEXT: Yesterday's finance call confirmed enterprise is off the table for now. Sage 200 covers most finance use cases, and €50K+ is too high for their company size. This call with Fernando is the swing vote—if revenue use cases validate, there's a path to a meaningful Teams deal with enterprise potential for FY27.\n\nCall Objectives\n\nValidate revenue assumptions: Get Fernando's real numbers on group RFQs, booking values, and lost revenue\n\nDefine trial success criteria: What does Fernando need to see to feel confident?\n\nAlign on realistic timeline: Set expectations for what's achievable in 2 weeks\n\nWhat We Know vs. What We Need\n\nWhat We Know\n\nWhat We Need Fernando to Validate\n\n~50 emails/property/day (Fernando's estimate)\n\nActual email volume from hotel data he collected\n\nResponse time: 24-48 hrs in busy season\n\nWhat response time would win them more bookings?\n\nAssumption: 2 lost bookings/month @ €3K avg\n\nCan he point to specific lost bookings? What's real avg value?\n\nROI estimate = ~3% of FY25 revenue (per Javier)\n\nDoes this feel right to Fernando as Head of Revenue?\n\nKey Questions to Ask\n\nValidating the Numbers\n\n\"You mentioned you collected data from the hotels. What did the numbers show?\"\n\n\"How many group RFQs do you get per month across all properties?\"\n\n\"What's your average group booking value?\"\n\n\"Can you think of specific bookings you lost because a competitor responded faster?\"\n\nTrial Success Criteria\n\nFrame it directly:\n\n\"By the end of this trial period, what do you need to see to feel confident this works for your team?\"\n\nIf He Says...\n\nImplication\n\nYour Response\n\n\"Show me it works with our systems\"\n\nConnections + demo\n\nAchievable in 2 weeks, low touch\n\n\"I want to see AI draft real responses\"\n\nAI demo with their data\n\nDoable—pull 5-10 real emails, show AI processing\n\n\"I need it running in production\"\n\nMismatch with deal economics\n\nReset expectation or discuss enterprise path\n\nTalking Points If He Wants Production-Ready\n\n\"We can absolutely get there, but building production-grade flows typically takes 4-6 weeks with our team's support. That level of investment usually comes with an enterprise partnership. For a Teams engagement, we'd get you to a working prototype and train Matteo to take it the rest of the way.\"\n\n\n\nThis isn't a threat—it's being clear about what different investment levels get them\n\nTests whether there's appetite for larger engagement, or if this is truly a €6K ceiling\n\nMatteo has already shown initiative (built MS Forms prototype)—he can own this\n\nOutcomes & Next Steps\n\nIf This Happens\n\nThen Do This\n\nRevenue numbers validate (€50K+/year impact)\n\nPush for Teams close in Q1\n\nPosition enterprise revisit for FY27 budget (Aug/Sep)\n\nDiscuss adding petty cash + reservation automation together\n\nNumbers are soft or lower than expected\n\nThis is a €6K Teams deal, period\n\nFocus on petty cash + light reservation automation\n\nGet Matteo trained, minimize your time investment\n\nDon't Forget\n\nJavier and Matteo likely NOT on this call—Fernando owns revenue\n\nFernando was supposed to send hotel data before this meeting—ask about it\n\nJan 28 build session with Matteo already scheduled for petty cash\n\nHR best practices session offered—follow up when they're ready",

      "content": "Cool Rooms: Finance Discovery Call\n\nMonday, January 19 | 30 minutes | Javier Raynaud + Matteo Secci\n\n\n\nCall Objectives\n\nYOUR GOALS\n\nGet Javier to validate ROI assumptions\n\nUnderstand finance team pain points\n\nSurface tech/security/governance requirements\n\nDefine path to enterprise pitch\n\nTHEIR GOALS\n\nLearn what finance automation is possible\n\nUnderstand ROI potential for their team\n\nSee examples from similar companies\n\nFigure out next projects after reservations\n\n\n\nConversation Flow\n\nOpen (2 min): \"Year-end close behind you? Ready to look at what automation could do for finance?\"\n\nCurrent State Discovery (8 min): Understand their finance processes, pain points, tool stack\n\nUse Case Showcase (10 min): Present 3-4 relevant finance automations from other customers\n\nROI Validation (5 min): Walk through assumptions, get their input on what's realistic\n\nTech/Security Questions (3 min): Surface any IT requirements that could become blockers\n\nClose (2 min): Align on next steps - trial checkpoint, enterprise pitch timing\n\n\n\nDiscovery Questions\n\nCurrent State\n\nWhat are the biggest time sinks for your finance team today?\n\nWalk me through your month-end close process. Where do things get stuck?\n\nHow do you handle AP invoice processing today? How many invoices per month?\n\nWhat happens when a vendor email with an invoice comes in? Who touches it, how many times?\n\nYou mentioned SalesCloud is connected to your PMS (News) - how does that work today?\n\n\n\nPain Points\n\nOn the last call, Matteo mentioned hitting issues with n8n and Outlook in your corporate network. What happened there?\n\nWhat manual tasks are most frustrating for your team?\n\nWhere do errors or delays typically happen?\n\n\n\nFinance Use Cases to Present\n\nPick 3-4 based on what resonates in discovery. These are real examples from the AutomateFlow customer base.\n\n1. AP Invoice Processing & Routing\n\nThe Problem: Vendor invoices arrive by email and get buried. Finance has to manually check inbox, download attachments, enter into accounting system, and track for approval.\n\nThe Automation: \n\nEmail with invoice attachment arrives\n\nAutomateFlow extracts vendor, amount, due date (AI can read invoices)\n\nCreates record in tracking spreadsheet with all details + attachment link\n\nRoutes to correct approver based on amount threshold or vendor\n\nSends reminder if not approved within X days\n\nWhy It Matters for Cool Rooms: 4 properties = 4x the vendor invoices. Month-end close is painful because invoices are scattered across inboxes.\n\n\n\n2. Expense Receipt Forwarding\n\nThe Problem: Staff email receipts throughout the week. Finance manually collects them for reconciliation. Receipts get lost or arrive late.\n\nThe Automation: \n\nStaff member labels email as \"expense\" (one click)\n\nAutomateFlow forwards to finance inbox with standardized subject line\n\nCreates row in expense tracking sheet with date, sender, amount, attachment\n\nAll receipts in one place for reconciliation\n\nWhy It Matters for Cool Rooms: Front desk and ops staff across properties can easily submit receipts. Finance gets clean audit trail.\n\n\n\n3. Daily Cash Position / Approvals Summary\n\nThe Problem: Finance lead spends first 30 minutes of each day pulling together cash position and pending approvals from multiple sources.\n\nThe Automation: \n\nScheduled trigger at 7am every business day\n\nPulls latest values from accounting system, bank, outstanding invoices\n\nFormats summary with key metrics and items needing attention\n\nSends to Javier (or finance team channel) first thing in the morning\n\nWhy It Matters for Cool Rooms: Javier starts the day with visibility across all 4 properties without manual pulling.\n\n\n\n4. Commission/Booking-to-Invoice Automation (Travel/Hospitality)\n\nThe Problem: Bookings sit in the reservation system while finance manually creates invoices. Delays commission payouts, causes errors in invoice numbers, missed confirmations.\n\nThe Automation: \n\nNew confirmed booking in PMS triggers workflow\n\nLooks up customer in accounting platform\n\nCreates invoice with confirmation number, booking dates, amounts\n\nIf confirmation number needs review, routes email to finance\n\nWhy It Matters for Cool Rooms: Group bookings are a key revenue driver. Faster invoicing = faster payment = better cash flow.\n\n\n\nROI Validation\n\nROI Calculator: https://example.com/...\n\n\n\nAnchor Position: $100K+ annual value = 3.9x ROI on $82K investment\n\n\n\nCategory\n\nValue\n\nKey Assumption to Validate\n\nRevenue Impact\n\n$298K\n\n\n\n  Group Bookings Recovered\n\n$100K+\n\n4/month at risk × €10K × 50% capture\n\n  Individual Reservations\n\n$20-50K\n\n8/month at risk × €700 × 50% capture\n\nTime Savings\n\n$24K\n\n\n\n  Reservations + Finance + HR\n\n$20-50K\n\n~140 hrs/month across departments\n\n\n\nValidation Questions (anchor high, adjust down):\n\n\"What's a typical group RFQ worth? Corporate events, weddings?\" → Validate €10K\n\n\"Across 4 properties, how many group inquiries slip through due to slow response?\" → Validate 1/property/month\n\n\"What's your average individual booking value? Nightly rate × avg stay?\" → Validate €600-700\n\n\"For finance - how many hours per month on invoice processing and month-end?\"\n\n\n\nThe Framing: \"Our analysis suggests you're leaving €300K+ on the table annually from slow response times. Even if we're off by half, that's still a 2x return.\"\n\n\n\nTech / Security / Governance Questions\n\nSurface blockers now, not in procurement.\n\n\n\nOutlook/Network: \"Matteo mentioned n8n had issues with Outlook in your corporate network. What happened? Is IT involved in approving new tools?\"\n\nSecurity Review: \"For a tool that touches email and finance data - does that require a security review? SOC 2 compliance?\"\n\nData Residency: \"Any requirements on where data is processed? EU-only?\"\n\nSSO/SAML: \"Does your company require SSO for all tools? Or is email/password acceptable?\"\n\nProcurement: \"For a €50-75K investment, what's the approval process look like? Legal review? Procurement?\"\n\nEconomic Buyer: \"Who else needs to sign off on a partnership this size? Is there a CEO or owner in the picture?\"\n\n\n\nClose: Next Steps to Propose\n\nTrial checkpoint (late Jan): Review reservation automation build, expand to finance use case if trial is going well\n\nFinance use case scoping: If they're excited, pick ONE finance use case to prototype during trial period\n\nEnterprise pitch (early Feb): If trial validates, bring in SA for multi-department transformation pitch\n\n\n\nKey Question to Land: \"If the reservation trial goes well and you see the finance use cases working - what would need to happen to move to an enterprise conversation in February?\"\n\n\n\nStakeholder Notes\n\nPerson\n\nRole\n\nKey Notes\n\nJavier Raynaud\n\nFinance/Accounting Lead\n\nPrice-conscious (\"money talks\"). Needs hard ROI. Controls finance but unclear if can approve €75K.\n\nMatteo Secci\n\nFinance, Technical\n\nHas n8n experience. Started hiring workflow but hit Outlook/network issues. James build automations.\n\n\n\nKey Quotes from Discovery\n\n\"I would love to do it by myself, but I need somebody to teach me.\" - Fernando (SA value prop)\n\n\"Money talks.\" - Javier (needs hard ROI)\n\n\"As a five star boutique deluxe hotel...we don't want to build this kind of response.\" - Fernando (brand matters)\n\n\"We really want to have some brainstorming from your side.\" - Matteo (open to ideas)",

Front desk staff are serving guests while emails pile up. The Cost Group RFQs go to 8-10 hotels. The first one to respond with a quality answer often wins. Slow response = lost revenue. The Goal AI-assisted responses that maintain your five-star quality while dramatically reducing response time. 24-48h Current response time in busy season \"If the hotel next door responds in an hour, maybe they go to the hotel next door instead\"\n\nVALIDATION Confirming the Numbers You collected data from the hotels. Let's review what the numbers show. What We Assumed Question for You ~50 emails/property/day What did the hotel data actually show? Response time: 24-48 hrs in busy season What response time would win more bookings? 4 lost bookings/month @ ~€10K average Can you point to specific examples? What's the real average? ~€300K/year potential impact Does this feel right to you as Head of Revenue?\n\nTRIAL SUCCESS What Do You Need to See? \"By the end of this trial, what would convince you this works for your team?\" 01 See the Connections Outlook connected, AI configured, architecture demonstrated. Achievable in 2 weeks. 02 AI on Real Emails Pull 5-10 real reservation emails, watch AI draft responses, validate quality together. 03 Running in Production Handling live traffic. Typically 4-6 weeks with dedicated support.\n\nPATH FORWARD Next Steps TODAY Review the Data Walk through what you collected from the hotels JAN 28 Build Session with Matteo Start connecting systems, configure AI responses EARLY FEB Trial Checkpoint Review progress, decide on next phase FOR TODAY What did the hotel data show? What response time would win you more bookings? What would FlowBuilder you confident this works?\n\nQuestions? Let's FlowBuilder sure we're building what CoolRooms needs",
